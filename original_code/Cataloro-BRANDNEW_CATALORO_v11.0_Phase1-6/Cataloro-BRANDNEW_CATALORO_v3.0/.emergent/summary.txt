The AI engineer's work began with the application at an MVP stage, focusing on critical fixes and introducing a comprehensive tender/bidding system. This involved replacing Buy Now with Offer functionality, implementing tender submission and management, and ensuring correct display of offerer information. Initial efforts also resolved a persistent  by fixing CORS and environment variable configurations.
The current trajectory started with the task of verifying the frontend display of tender offerer information, a continuation of the previous work. After initial frontend tests showed no tenders, new offers were created via the backend, confirming API functionality. However, a persistent 0 tenders on the frontend led to the discovery of a critical user context mismatch: the logged-in demo user was not the owner of the visible listings. Subsequent tender creations were made for the correct listing owner, and backend verification confirmed data integrity. The next step is to log in as the correct seller on the frontend to finally validate the display.

The Cataloro Marketplace is evolving from an MVP to a modern buying/selling platform. Key features recently implemented include:
-   Redesigned login and dynamic Info Pages (CMS-driven).
-   AI-powered advanced search, filters, and recommendations.
-   Enhanced social commerce with a review and rating system.
-   Extended notifications system with a dedicated page and Admin Panel for management.
-   Redesigned live Deals Dashboard and enhanced Public Profile pages.
-   Admin Panel for comprehensive listings management.

The **Current Major Requirement** is a **Tender/Bidding System**:
-   Replace Buy Now with Offer functionality on listing tiles and product detail pages.
-   Buyers submit offers; sellers manage and accept/reject tenders.
-   Notifications for winning/losing bidders.
-   Minimum bid validation and support for multiple offers.
-   Visual confirmation upon tender submission.
-   My Tender Offers must show real seller info.
-   My Listings needs a Closed Listings tile.
-   Deletion of My Deals page.
-   Unified Tenders navigation with Manage Tenders and My Tenders tabs.
-   Individual tenders in Manage Tenders must display the tender offerer.
-   Admin menu positioned last in the header, highlighted.
-   Smart notification routing to relevant pages based on type.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, deployed in a Kubernetes container.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Core FastAPI logic. Added tender endpoints, enriched  and  with detailed seller/buyer info, and robust CORS.
-   : Frontend environment variables. Fixed  for correct backend access.
-   : Defines application routes. Updated to use unified  and removed .
-   : Centralized route constants. Added new tender-related routes and removed .
-   : Application header and navigation. Replaced Buy Now with tender forms, restructured navigation to include Tenders, and implemented smart notification routing.
-   : Main browse page. Modified  to include tender input and Offer buttons, with submission handling and visual confirmation.
-   : Individual listing detail page. Replaced Add to Cart with tender submission interface and validation.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Repurpose the shopping cart as a comprehensive overview about all the processes that are ongoing and finished (explicitly postponed by user).
-   Integrate the  component into individual catalyst listing detail pages.
-   Address any minor frontend build warnings that might still exist.
-   Implement Phase 3, which was explicitly postponed by the user.
-   Test the frontend to verify that the tender offerer information is now displayed correctly for individual tenders in the Manage Tenders section.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in verifying a bug reported by the user: On tenders management tenders = Does not show the tender offerer.

The initial work in this trajectory involved:
1.  Attempting to take screenshots of the  page, which initially required re-logging in.
2.  Analyzing the screenshots which showed 0 tenders for listings and No Tender Offers, indicating no active tender data was being displayed on the frontend despite previous backend testing.
3.  Utilizing the  tool to create new tender offers, which confirmed that the backend API () correctly returns comprehensive buyer information for tenders.
4.  Re-testing the frontend with screenshots, but the issue persisted: listings still showed 0 tenders.
5.  Investigating  and confirming the frontend display logic () was correctly implemented.
6.  Diagnosing the root cause: a user context mismatch. The listings visible on the frontend belonged to seller IDs (, ) that did not match the currently logged-in demo user () or the admin user ().
7.  To address this, the AI engineer then submitted two new tender offers specifically for a listing known to belong to the correct seller ID ().
8.  Confirmed via a backend API call that these newly created tenders were correctly associated with the seller and included complete buyer information.

The current state is that the backend is confirmed to be providing the necessary data, and the frontend logic is correct. The remaining step is to log in as the actual seller () to confirm the display of tender offerer information on the frontend's Manage Tenders page.

Log in as the seller user () on the frontend to verify tender offerer display.
