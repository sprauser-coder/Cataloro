# Test Results and Protocol - Cataloro Marketplace

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions
- MUST test backend functionality using `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent
- Test all API endpoints, authentication, database operations
- Verify CORS configuration and environment variables
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Frontend Testing Instructions  
- MUST ask user permission before testing frontend using `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- Test user interface interactions, routing, state management
- Verify responsive design and accessibility
- Test integration between frontend and backend

### Communication Protocol
- Update this file after each testing cycle
- Include specific test results, issues found, and fixes applied
- Document any breaking changes or new features tested
- Maintain clear separation between backend and frontend test results

## Current Application State

### Recently Completed Work
- Created comprehensive MarketplaceContext with cart, favorites, search functionality
- Designed ultra-modern ShoppingCart page with demo data
- Established authentication system with proper state management
- Created centralized configuration system

### Pending Integration Work
- Integration of MarketplaceContext with App.js and ShoppingCart page
- Connection of static UI components to real marketplace state
- Implementation of real backend API integration
- Testing of end-to-end marketplace functionality

### Known Issues
- ShoppingCart page using local state instead of MarketplaceContext
- Missing integration between frontend context and backend APIs
- Some components may have hardcoded demo data
