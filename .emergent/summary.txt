The Cataloro marketplace, initially developed from an MVP, now focuses on deployment. The previous AI engineer fixed a critical image upload bug in  and set up the self-hosted VPS (AlmaLinux 8.10). This involved Python, Node.js, PM2, MongoDB, and Nginx installations, cloning the codebase to , and installing dependencies.

The current challenge is stabilizing the deployment. Recurring issues included user command concatenation leading to corrupted config files ( and Nginx conf) and, critically, a Python package incompatibility ( with ) causing the backend to crash. The Nginx configuration and frontend build are complete and verified. The PM2  process repeatedly fails, and the immediate task is to diagnose why  is not providing output.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like platform for cash transactions, intentionally excluding payment integrations. It features user roles, product listings, cart, order management, and reviews. Implemented features include Cataloro branding, a comprehensive 8-tab admin panel (Dashboard, Users, Listings, Orders, Appearance, Page Management, General Settings, Database), a CMS for site settings and dynamic pages, auto-generated sequential user IDs, and image uploads for logos (PNG) and listings (up to 3, PNG/JPEG). The hero section height is adjustable via the admin panel, and all currency symbols are €. The current overarching goal is deploying the application to  (IP: 217.154.0.82) on a self-hosted AlmaLinux 8.10 server.

<current_work>
The current focus is resolving a critical deployment issue on the user's AlmaLinux 8.10 VPS. The environment is mostly set up: Python 3.11.13, Node.js 20.19.4, PM2 6.0.8, MongoDB v6.0.25, and Nginx 1.14.1 are installed and active. The Cataloro codebase is cloned to , backend and frontend dependencies are installed (with some noted downgrades in Python packages).

Recently, the environment variables in  and  were successfully updated for production, and the frontend was built (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.). Nginx has been configured and reloaded to serve the frontend and proxy API requests.

However, the  PM2 service is in an  state, restarting repeatedly. Logs revealed a  originating from , indicating a **version incompatibility between Pydantic 1.8.2 and Python 3.11.13**.
