The AI engineer successfully guided the Cataloro marketplace from initial deployment on a self-hosted AlmaLinux VPS to implementing significant feature enhancements across multiple phases. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes: resolving  and  misconfigurations, fixing JWT import errors, and most importantly, rectifying image upload and display across frontend and backend. A robust one-command  script was established and refined through iterative debugging.

Subsequent development proceeded in phases:
*   **Phase 1 (Dashboard & Admin Panel)**: Improvements to admin dashboard (analytics graph, user stats size) and listings overview (image thumbnails).
*   **Phase 2 (Appearance & Theming)**: Dynamic typography previews, custom theme colors (font, link, hover), hero section enhancements (image above title, background image option), and main page background change. This phase required significant bug fixing related to  dependency, database persistence for new fields, and styling application.
*   **Phase 3 (New Features)**: This was further split into sub-phases:
    *   **3A (Core Content Management)**: Page Management, Profile page, Footer versioning, and hero height setting cleanup. This involved backend endpoint creation and model updates.
    *   **3B (Advanced Listings Management)**: Implementation of bulk actions (delete, update, price adjust, export) for listings in the admin panel.
    *   **3C (Order Processing & Notification System)**: Real-time WebSocket-based notifications, and a comprehensive order approval workflow.
    *   **3D (Browse Page Enhancements)**: Advanced sorting and filtering options for listings on the public browse page.

The work was characterized by a systematic approach to debugging, often involving detailed frontend and backend testing, and adapting strategies (e.g., removing  for a CSS-based solution due to deployment issues). The current state is that Phase 3 has been declared complete, but the user has immediately reported two critical bugs: Page Management not allowing new page creation and the Footer version not updating. The AI engineer is currently investigating these issues.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like e-commerce platform for cash transactions, featuring buyer/seller roles, product listings, a shopping cart, order management, and user reviews. It includes an 8-tab admin panel for managing users, listings, orders, appearance, pages, general settings, and database, with CMS support. Key features involve auto-generated user IDs, image uploads (PNG for logos, PNG/JPEG for listings), configurable hero sections, and a default € currency. The initial goal was successful deployment and full functionality on a self-hosted AlmaLinux 8.10 VPS at  (IP: ), ensuring image displays and listing creation work correctly.

**Feature Development So Far (User's Requests):**
*   **Dashboard**: Remove visitor countries and quick actions; add graph for daily completed listings (red), active listings (blue), pending orders (orange).
*   **Users Panel**: Decrease size of orders/listings/spent bar.
*   **Listings (Admin)**: Add first picture of the listing to the overview.
*   **Appearance – Typography**: Sample text (H1-H5) to change font with font picker.
*   **Theme Colours**: Add Font colour, Link Color, Link Colour-hover options.
*   **Hero Section**: Add option for PNG image above hero title; add background image option (not just gradient/color).
*   **Page Management**: Complete functionality.
*   **General Settings**: Delete Hero section height picker.
*   **Profile Page**: Create, showing/allowing change of username, full name, statistics, history.
*   **Main Page Background**: Change to light grey.
*   **Footer**: Add version number (1.0.0 DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm, auto-updating).
*   **Listings (Admin)**: Add bulk actions (delete, change details, mass operations).
*   **Order Processing**: Add notification center for all users; implement order approval workflow (pending -> seller approval -> sold/archive -> delete from open listings).
*   **Browse Page Filters**: Add sorting (highest/lowest price, creation date/time); prepare for future (region, distance).

<current_work>
The immediate work involved addressing two critical bugs reported by the user after Phase 3 was declared complete. The user stated: page management: Not able to create new pages : ERROR and Version has not been updated to 1.0.1.

The AI engineer has acknowledged these bugs and is currently focused on fixing them. The last explicit action taken was to begin investigating the Page Management Creation Error. The AI engineer was looking into the  file, specifically examining the  component, to identify and add any missing page management functions that might be preventing new pages from being created. The user has just reiterated their readiness for deployment, but the AI engineer has correctly responded that critical bugs need to be fixed first.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue debugging and implementing the missing Page Management functions in  and investigate the Footer versioning bug.
