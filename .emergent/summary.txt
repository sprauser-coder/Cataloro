The trajectory details the development of the Cataloro Marketplace Web App by an AI engineer. Initially, the environment was cleared of previous project files. The user then provided detailed product requirements, including a feature-based, scalable architecture, central configuration via a directions file, an ultra-modern UI with specific navigation, and deployment instructions for an external SSH server.

The AI engineer proceeded in phases: foundation setup, core feature implementation, and UI design. Key challenges included resolving environment configuration issues (hardcoded production URLs), fixing a circular dependency between  and , addressing React development server host header validation for the preview URL, and correcting routing in  to enable full marketplace access. The engineer diligently used troubleshooting tools and systematically debugged issues, making incremental fixes to , , context providers, and  proxy settings. The latest work focuses on making all newly designed features fully functional, beginning with the shopping cart, by introducing a .

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a complete server wipe and a fresh start due to previous conflicts. Following this, the core requirement was to build Cataloro, a scalable, ultra-modern Marketplace Web App, with eventual mobile app compatibility.

Key features and architectural requirements:
- **Architecture:** A corporate, feature-based  structure (components, features, hooks, services, utils, context) for maintainability, scalability, testability, and reusability.
- **Centralized Configuration:** A directions file for all paths and links to avoid hardcoding.
- **URLs/CORS:** Frontend at  (no port), Backend CORS for , .
- **UI/UX:** Ultra-modern design with a header navigation.
- **Menu Points:** Browse, My Listings, My Deals, *Admin Panel (for admin), Favorites, Notifications (bell icon), Profile Page (settings), Logout.
- **Page Specifics:** Tile patterns for active listings (Browse) and user listings (My Listings). Deals page for executed transactions. Admin Panel with full KPIs, user management, and site look/feel control (including logo upload/change). Notifications as a bell symbol. Profile page as a dummy for now.
- **Deployment:** Save files directly to GitHub, create a deploy script for SSH server at  to .
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Context API (AuthContext, NotificationContext, MarketplaceContext), Environment Variables ().
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB, CORS.
- **Deployment:** Supervisor, SSH deployment scripts.
- **Configuration:** Centralized  for paths/URLs.
- **Debugging:** Host header validation, circular dependencies in React contexts, browser caching.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, using MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   
    -   **Importance:** Centralized configuration for all frontend and backend URLs, API endpoints, and routes. Crucial for environment-agnostic development.
    -   **Changes:** Initially configured for production URLs (), then modified to correctly detect and use development URLs (, ) and later preview URLs ().
-   
    -   **Importance:** Main FastAPI application defining backend routes, database connection, and CORS policies.
    -   **Changes:** Implemented health check, user authentication, profile retrieval, marketplace endpoints. CORS updated to include , , and the preview domain. Fixed  logic.
-   
    -   **Importance:** Main React component, responsible for routing, global state providers (Auth, Notification, Marketplace), and overall application layout.
    -   **Changes:** Evolved from a minimal test app (, ) to the full application with  and . Updated to use  and include routes for new features like , , . Set up to use .
-   
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment variables for the frontend.
    -   **Changes:** Added  to resolve Invalid Host header errors with the preview system.
-   , 
    -   **Importance:** Manage global authentication and notification states.
    -   **Changes:**  was refactored to resolve a circular dependency issue with  during initialization, making notification fetching conditional on user presence.
-   , , 
    -   **Importance:** Core UI components for navigation, header, and overall page structure.
    -   **Changes:** Updated for an ultra-modern design, replacing sidebar navigation with a header. Adapted to check authentication status via  for robustness. Fixed icon imports (e.g., ).
-   
    -   **Importance:** A temporary login page used for debugging, then adapted to be the functional login page.
    -   **Changes:** Initially displayed a dummy login. Later, updated to use  for real backend authentication, show user status, and include logout functionality, with redirection to  upon successful login.
-   
    -   **Importance:** Configures Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to support dark mode and custom animations for the ultra-modern design.
-   
    -   **Importance:** Manages frontend dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes:** Added proxy configuration to direct  requests to the backend, crucial for inter-service communication in the preview environment.
-   , 
    -   **Importance:** New contexts introduced to manage marketplace-specific state (e.g., products, cart items).
    -   **Changes:** Created as part of the current work to implement fully functional marketplace features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with making everything functioning and ensuring all the Button etc working for the ultra-modern redesigned Cataloro marketplace. The application now boasts a sleek header navigation, dark mode, gradient backgrounds, and various marketplace pages (Browse, Categories, Shopping Cart, Product Detail).

The AI engineer has initiated the process of adding real state management and functionality. As part of this, two new context files have been created:  and . The current step is to create a fully functional Shopping Cart and update  to integrate these new marketplace contexts, thereby moving from static display to interactive features.
