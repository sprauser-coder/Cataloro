The trajectory details an extensive debugging and deployment process for an eBay-like marketplace. The primary goal was to guide the user in deploying a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB on an AlmaLinux VPS. The AI engineer meticulously troubleshot numerous issues, including Python dependency conflicts (/ incompatibility, missing ), corrupted files due to incorrect bash heredoc usage, shell history expansion errors, and critical Node.js/React compatibility problems ( with Node 18, Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS integration with Create React App). The AI persistently guided the user through cleanup, correct file creation, and package installations, ultimately achieving a fully operational backend under PM2 and a successfully compiling React frontend with essential dependencies.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an eBay-like marketplace application with core functionalities including user registration (buyers/sellers), product search (with categorization), a shopping cart, distinct buyer/seller accounts, and a ratings/reviews system. Crucially, it does not require payment integration, as sales are intended to be person-to-person cash transactions. The application was initially developed as an MVP using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The previous AI engineer also integrated an authentication system and various marketplace pages. The ongoing work centers on deploying this complete application on the user's AlmaLinux VPS.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Frontend framework for UI development.
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework for backend APIs.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
-   **PM2**: Node.js process manager for application lifecycle.
-   **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
-   **Python Virtual Environments**: Isolation for backend dependencies.
-   **Tailwind CSS (v3/v4)**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **Node.js/Yarn**: JavaScript runtime and package manager for frontend.
-   **Nginx**: Web server for reverse proxy (pending).
-   **SSL/Certbot**: For HTTPS (pending).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure.



-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies, fixed to , , , ,  (among others) to ensure compatibility with Python 3.6.8 and resolve internal conflicts.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The main FastAPI application. Initially corrupted and then rewritten line-by-line, it now contains full API logic for user auth, product listings, cart, orders, and reviews.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains , , , . Crucial for environment-specific backend configuration.
-   **/app/backend/ecosystem.config.js**: PM2 configuration file, corrected to use  to correctly launch the FastAPI server from within its virtual environment, ensuring auto-start and management.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Manages Node.js project dependencies, including , , , .
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Contains , essential for the frontend to communicate with the backend.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Initial CSS file, modified to remove  directives during troubleshooting, now a basic CSS file.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Similar to , modified to remove Tailwind directives.
-   **/app/frontend/postcss.config.js**: Configured to include only  to resolve Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS plugin conflicts with Create React App.
-   **/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js**: Initially created but its content was later removed or simplified during Tailwind CSS troubleshooting.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Set up the frontend React app components (Home, Authentication, Product Details, Cart, User Dashboard).
-   Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for the frontend and backend.
-   Configure the firewall (firewalld) to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from outside the VPS.
-   Configure DNS records on Ionos for the user's domain.
-   Set up SSL certificates using Certbot.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has successfully guided the user through a complex deployment process to a state where the core application foundation is robust. The FastAPI backend is fully deployed on the AlmaLinux VPS, running under PM2 management, ensuring auto-restart and auto-start on server reboot. All backend API endpoints (user authentication, product listings, shopping cart, order management, reviews, search, and filtering) have been verified to be operational through local  commands on the VPS.

On the frontend side, a basic React application (with TypeScript support) has been successfully initialized using . All essential frontend dependencies, including  (for API communication),  (for UI icons), and  (for multi-page routing), are installed and verified. Crucially, previous issues related to Node.js version incompatibility with  and PostCSS configuration conflicts with Tailwind CSS (implicitly pulled by ) have been resolved through targeted package versioning and careful removal/creation of configuration files. The frontend is now able to compile and run its development server on  without errors.

The project is at a pivotal point where the entire backend is complete and functional, and the frontend's technical foundation is fully set up, ready for the implementation of the actual UI components and pages.
