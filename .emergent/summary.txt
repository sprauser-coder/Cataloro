The trajectory chronicles an expert AI engineer's work on the Cataloro Marketplace application, focusing on bug fixes and feature enhancements initially requested by the user. The engineer systematically addressed six distinct tasks: fixing message page scrolling, reordering Sell tabs, renaming the Admin Panel tab, auditing/optimizing base64 images, managing expired listings, and implementing a complex Partners feature. While simpler tasks were quickly resolved and verified, the Partners feature—involving exclusive listing visibility, partner management, and UI badges—proved highly iterative due to underlying data persistence and authentication issues.

The core challenge revolved around partner-only listing data not being correctly saved to the database during creation, and a mismatch in authentication  values between token creation and verification. Despite frontend UI showing partner-only settings, backend persistence failed. The engineer iteratively debugged by adding extensive logging, simulating scenarios, and fixing these root causes. The task concluded with the simplified Partner Offer badge still not displaying, pointing to persistent issues in data flow or frontend rendering conditions, although the underlying partner visibility filtering (non-partners cannot see) appears to be working.

The Cataloro Marketplace aims to be a robust buying and selling platform. Initial requirements involved replacing dummy data and improving code quality. Key features include secure bidding, consistent tender notifications, unique listing view tracking, accurate favorite listing management, and a functional messaging system. The Admin Panel needs accurate listing counts and real-time business metrics. A Completed Transactions feature allows buyers and sellers to manage order completion, with an Admin view. Navigation was overhauled, introducing Buy and Sell top-level menus with nested sub-tabs.

Recent enhancements involved:
1.  **Messages Page Scroll Fix:** Scroll should be confined to the messages container.
2.  **Partners Feature:** A new system allowing sellers to designate preferred partners. Listings can be set to Show Partners First, making them exclusively visible to partners for a defined period (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 1 week, or 1 minute) before becoming public. The admin is always a hidden partner. This feature also requires a Partners tab in Profile Settings for management and a badge on listings indicating partner exclusivity/status.
3.  **Reorder Sell Tabs:** Tabs in the Sell section should be reordered to: My Listings; Sell Tenders; Accepted Tenders; Completed.
4.  **Expired Listings Management:** Expired listings should remain visible in the user's My Listings with a Set Online Again button, but be removed from the public browse page until reactivated.
5.  **Admin Panel Rename:** The Administration tab in the Admin Panel should be renamed to Sections.
6.  **Base64 Images Audit:** A comprehensive check to ensure no large base64-encoded images are being transferred in API responses.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React (Hooks, Context API, useState, useEffect), Axios, React Router, Tailwind CSS (for UI).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (Motor, for database operations), JWT (for authentication),  (for timezones),  (for image handling).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor (for process management).
-   **Performance Optimization**: Image data optimization, conditional API calls, state management.
-   **Data Handling**: Server-side pagination, independent user confirmation for transactions, UUIDs for IDs.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a MERN-like stack with React on the frontend, FastAPI on the backend, and MongoDB as the database, deployed within a Kubernetes environment. Backend API routes are consistently prefixed with .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing and debugging the Partners Feature, specifically the display of a Partner Offer badge and a countdown timer for partner-only listings.

Following user feedback, the engineer simplified the feature:
1.  **Removed the complex countdown badge** and replaced it with a simpler Partner Offer badge in  (frontend).
2.  **Added a 1 minute option** to the partner visibility duration in the  form (frontend).
3.  **Investigated database persistence:** Multiple attempts to create partner-only listings revealed that the , , and  fields were not being saved to the MongoDB database, resulting in listings being treated as regular listings despite frontend UI indicating partner-only settings. This was identified as the core issue preventing the badges from displaying correctly.
4.  **Debugging :** Debug logging was added to the  POST endpoint to trace the  before database insertion, indicating that the partner data was being lost during the save process. Initial fixes included explicit boolean and integer conversions for partner-related fields, but these changes temporarily broke listing creation entirely and were partially reverted.

The current state is that the backend's partner visibility *filtering* mechanism (i.e., non-partners cannot see partner-only listings) is confirmed to be working, but the **Partner Offer badge is not displaying** because the partner-only data is not being correctly saved to the database during listing creation. The engineer is preparing to check backend debug logs to determine why the  data isn't being received or saved.
