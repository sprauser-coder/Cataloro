The previous AI engineer effectively stabilized the deployment pipeline and confirmed backend API functionality. The initial task was to resolve frontend login issues related to an incorrect  and Nginx configuration. This was addressed by updating frontend and backend environment variables and rebuilding. A new login design was requested by the user, leading to a  error and a persistent white screen on the frontend. Extensive debugging, including reverting changes and creating minimal React components, revealed a fundamental JavaScript runtime issue preventing React from mounting. Although the AI successfully made a minimal React app render, and subsequently restored the authentication code into , the final state still exhibits a white screen with an empty  element, implying a lingering, subtle JavaScript runtime error preventing the complete React application from initializing, despite the authentication code being present in the build.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like e-commerce platform with buyer/seller roles, product listings, order management, and an 8-tab admin panel. Key implemented features include a dashboard, user statistics, listing image thumbnails, dynamic typography, custom themes, enhanced hero section, Content Management, Profile page, and a dynamic Footer. The current focus is on stabilizing core application functionality and then implementing a modern UI design and messaging features. Specific tasks included fixing login issues on the server , implementing an elegant new login page design (purple gradient, uploaded logo, removed demo credentials), and resolving a critical white screen issue preventing the frontend from rendering, followed by restoring the full authentication system.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, defining API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: No direct code changes, but dependency versions were previously managed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, handles UI, routing, and overall application logic. Contains the primary application structure and component rendering, including authentication.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   Initially modified to dynamically read  version and use environment variables for WebSockets.
        *   Extensively modified to implement a new login design, including purple gradients, layout changes, and incorporating .
        *   Later, modified to remove  references after a runtime error ().
        *   Reverted and simplified multiple times during white screen debugging, eventually replaced with a minimal Hello, React! component.
        *   Finally, restored to include the full authentication system logic, but stripped of problematic CMS initialization.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores frontend environment variables, crucially .
    -   **Changes**: Updated  from a preview URL to  to fix login issues. Later reverted to  during white screen debugging, and then re-set to  for production builds.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores backend environment variables, including  and .
    -   **Changes**:  was updated to include  and  to allow frontend-backend communication. Later reverted to include .

<current_work>
The system is currently in a state where the backend APIs are fully functional and accessible from the specified server IP (). The frontend application's HTML and basic page structure load correctly, including the Made with Emergent badge. The authentication system's code has been restored in  and confirmed to be present in the built JavaScript bundles (e.g.,  contains references like Welcome Back). However, the React application still fails to initialize and render its components, resulting in a persistent white screen for the user, with the  div remaining empty. This indicates an underlying JavaScript runtime error is preventing React from mounting, even after debugging and reverting several changes. The latest attempt involved serving a production build with the restored authentication system, which still yielded the white screen. The root cause appears to be a subtle frontend JavaScript issue that is not immediately apparent from server logs or superficial code reviews.
