The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Cataloro Marketplace from an MVP state to an enhanced application through a series of iterative development phases. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes and minor feature enhancements, including public profiles, notification alignment, My Deals page improvements, and messaging system enhancements with full-page chat and message highlighting.

Subsequent major development phases involved a complete redesign of the Login Page, creating a new, publicly accessible Info/Functionality Page, and implementing a robust Content Management System (CMS) within the Admin Panel. This CMS evolved from basic content editing to enterprise-level functionality, supporting rich text editing, SEO management, dynamic statistics, feature categories, testimonials, footer management, and comprehensive image handling. The Info page was made dynamic, loading all its content from this CMS. The navigation menus were updated to include the Info page and reordered based on user requests. Finally, the About page underwent a significant visual redesign, incorporating modern aesthetics, stock images, and dynamic foreground PNG image support in the hero section, all manageable via the enhanced CMS. Each phase involved iterative development, testing (backend and frontend screenshots), and verification.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace aims to be a modern buying and selling platform with core CRUD operations for listings, user profiles, and administrative tools. Initial requirements included UI/UX improvements, market price suggestions, detailed addresses, business accounts, and a comprehensive buy/sell transaction workflow. Key features implemented were a live messaging system (with full-page chat, message highlighting, unread counts), and a robust notification system with quick actions and an Admin Panel Notification Center. Bug fixes addressed public profile data, My Listings visibility, My Deals action buttons, and Pending Orders in the Admin Panel.

Recent development focused on redesigning the Login Page for a modern look, creating a new public Info Page to showcase functionalities, and implementing a fully functional Content Management System (CMS) in the Admin Panel for this Info page. The CMS was later enhanced to include advanced features like SEO meta-tags, dynamic sections (hero, statistics, features, testimonials, CTA, footer), and comprehensive image management. The About page (Info page) itself was redesigned to be modern and stylish, utilizing stock pictures, with full image management through the Admin Panel. Lastly, a foreground PNG image was requested for the Hero Section of the About Page, also editable via the Admin Panel.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on enhancing the About Page (which is the  route) to support a foreground PNG image in its Hero Section. This image needed to be fully editable and manageable through the Admin Panel's Content Management System (CMS).

The engineer first modified  to create the necessary UI structure to display a prominent PNG image alongside the existing hero content, and imported a  icon. Concurrently,  was updated to include new input fields and logic for managing this hero PNG image, including updating the default content structure to accommodate these new image fields.

After these frontend changes, the frontend service was restarted. The backend API for content management (in ) was then tested to ensure it could successfully save and retrieve the new hero image content. This backend testing achieved a 100% success rate, confirming that the new hero image fields are properly integrated into the CMS data model and persistence layer. The very last action recorded was an attempt to take a screenshot of the  page to visually confirm the implementation of the new hero section with PNG image support.
