The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on resolving critical deployment and synchronization issues for the Cataloro Marketplace application. Initial efforts addressed Git authentication failures encountered by the user when pushing manual VPS changes to GitHub, ultimately resolved by guiding the user to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) and troubleshooting repeated push/pull errors. A significant part of the conversation involved iteratively shortening and refining the  script, followed by diagnosing and fixing a frontend container restart loop. This loop was traced to an Nginx SSL certificate loading error, which was exacerbated by the  file being shared by both the frontend's Nginx and the main Nginx service. The AI successfully restored the main Nginx's SSL configuration, bringing the website back online via HTTPS. The environment has been synchronized, and the original pending tasksâ€”MongoDB Compass external connectivity and mobile logo displayâ€”remain.

The Cataloro Marketplace MVP aims for continuous improvement in mobile/desktop UI/UX, messaging, profile management, and overall UI consistency. The immediate and critical goal has been successful VPS deployment, ensuring React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and Nginx services function correctly with HTTPS on a custom domain. Prior implementations covered mobile UI/UX, messaging, notifications, and profile management. The current phase has focused heavily on resolving self-hosting deployment issues, including Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx SSL configuration, and MongoDB authentication. Progress includes resolving Nginx SSL certificate errors causing frontend container restart loops and streamlining the deployment script. Key remaining issues are persistent  errors for MongoDB Compass external connectivity and a mobile logo display fix.

<code_architecture>
The Cataloro Marketplace uses a MERN-like stack: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Docker Compose orchestrates these services. Backend API routes are prefixed with .



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines how the frontend Docker image is built, particularly for installing dependencies and building the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified  to  to resolve build errors when  was missing.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Nginx configuration file. Crucial for SSL termination, HTTP to HTTPS redirection, serving React static files, and proxying API requests to the backend. This file is mounted into the main  container.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially, a streamlined HTTP-only configuration was applied, which inadvertently broke the main Nginx's SSL. It was then fully restored to include HTTP to HTTPS redirection, SSL certificate configuration, API proxying to the backend, gzip compression, and static file caching.

    -   **Importance**: Bash script for managing Docker Compose services (build, start, stop, restart, logs).
    -   **Changes Made**: Significantly shortened from 136 lines to ~30 lines. Output was streamlined by redirecting  commands to , providing concise status messages (e.g., ðŸš€ Building... âœ… Deploy complete).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical deployment issue where the website was inaccessible via HTTPS. This was traced back to an incorrect  file being mounted into the main Nginx container (), which inadvertently removed the SSL server block. The AI engineer restored the comprehensive SSL Nginx configuration in  (which is mounted into ). After , HTTPS access to  was confirmed to be working.

Prior to this, the AI also streamlined the  script to provide concise output, and fixed a frontend Docker build error by changing  to . The development environment has been synchronized with the user's VPS after several Git authentication and merge resolution steps. The current state is that the core application is deployed and accessible via HTTPS, but the two main pending tasks remain: troubleshooting external MongoDB Compass connectivity and applying the mobile logo display fix.

Ask the user to prioritize between the MongoDB Compass connectivity issue and the mobile logo display improvements.
