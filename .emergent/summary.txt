The trajectory details an extensive, iterative development process for the Cataloro Marketplace, primarily driven by user feedback and bug reports. The AI engineer systematically tackled numerous UI/UX inconsistencies, particularly dark/light mode issues across various components like header icons, profile settings, and input fields. A major feature addition involved robust filter functionalities for the browse page (Type, Price Range) and a complete Edit Listing page, including necessary backend endpoints and frontend routing. Debugging often required deep dives into both React components and FastAPI logic, coupled with visual checks via screenshots and direct API calls. The engineer successfully resolved persistent CSS specificity issues, especially for dark mode text colors in input fields, and implemented complex feature logic like dynamic business badges and advanced search. The current state reflects a highly refined application with most reported issues addressed, but a critical data consistency problem regarding seller status on listings remains.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace is a full-stack application featuring a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Initial requirements focused on a modern UI with glassmorphism, responsiveness, and core CRUD operations for product listings, alongside user profiles and an Admin Panel. Subsequent developments included a Cat Database for admin, integrating Excel uploads, price calculations, and listing creation with . Live features like messaging, favorites, and cart management were implemented. Significant user-reported bugs were addressed, covering profile dark mode, favorites page updates, invisible UI elements, price display, listing visibility, image clickability, and backend data inconsistencies. Quantity controls were removed, currency standardized to Euro. Recent additions included market price suggestions, detailed address fields with location suggestions, and comprehensive business account settings (Company Name, Country, VAT Number) with dynamic Private/Business badges, ensuring persistence of all profile changes.

-   **Browse Page Tiles Seller Status**: The individual listings are not showing the correct Business or Private status for the seller. Specifically, the admin's listings are showing as Private instead of Business on the browse page, despite the profile being set to business. This requires changing the live status on the listing to always show the current state of the seller.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical data inconsistency issue on the Browse Page. The user reported that individual listing tiles were not displaying the correct Business or Private status for sellers. Specifically, the admin user's listings were incorrectly showing a Private badge, even though the admin's profile was configured as Business.

The AI engineer initiated debugging by:
1.  Taking screenshots of the Browse page to visually confirm the incorrect Private badges on listings.
2.  Examining the backend's  endpoint in  to understand how seller data, including , is fetched and enriched. The code appeared logically correct at first glance.
3.  Attempting to check backend logs, which initially failed due to incorrect log file paths.
4.  Performing a direct API call to  to inspect the raw backend response.
5.  **Identifying the root cause**: The API response clearly showed  for the admin's listing, even though the admin user's profile should have .

The work concluded at the point of diagnosing that the backend API is returning incorrect  data for the admin's listings, indicating a potential issue in how this status is stored or retrieved from the database, or how the seller object is constructed in the backend.
