<analysis>
The previous AI engineer made significant progress on the Cataloro Marketplace, primarily focusing on a mobile UI/UX redesign and implementing a new ads management system. Key achievements include successfully confirming that mobile listings are indeed displaying correctly, contradicting earlier reports. The engineer also fixed React Hooks errors in the desktop messaging and made initial attempts to resolve mobile messaging issues, which currently remain stuck in a loading conversations state. A new ads management system was built from scratch, involving backend API endpoints and a frontend admin panel component. This new system was integrated into the AdminPanel, and initial testing confirmed its visibility and functionality, although issues with session expiration and MongoDB ObjectId serialization required immediate fixes. The most recent efforts are concentrated on systematically debugging the mobile messenger's failure to load messages, specifically investigating the data flow to  after backend API functionality was confirmed.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace requires continuous restoration and enhancement, initially targeting performance, user management, and display bug fixes. Resolved tasks included a 0 catalysts available bug, enhanced search, and visual feedback for basket export. Recent explicit requests addressed involve:
- **Hero Section**: Applying Admin Panel changes, adding gradient options, centering, and background wrapping.
- **Performance**: Resolving slow fetching and phantom listings via caching.
- **Mobile Redesign (Ongoing)**: Complete mobile UI/UX redesign, fixing icon import errors (),   errors, React Router navigation for login, streamlining mobile menus (removing redundant items), fixing hero section text cutoff, styling the + button, removing Hot Deals and Message Now from mobile, redesigning mobile messenger for real data and full-screen display with auto-scroll, ensuring admin settings and logo display correctly, fixing individual listing page access, ensuring listings display real data (now confirmed working), and implementing logout functionality. Real-time badges for Messages and Cart were added to bottom navigation.
- **New Feature**: Implement an ads system where ads are inactive by default, requiring admin activation.
- **Persistent Issues**: Listings were reported as not clickable/visible (now confirmed working on mobile browse page), and messages are not sending/loading on mobile.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the mobile redesign, specifically resolving the issues with messages not loading/sending in the mobile messenger.
- Debug and fix why messages are not sending/loading in the mobile messenger.
- Fully test and validate the inactive by default functionality of the new ads system, including creating and activating/deactivating ads through the admin panel.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting the mobile messaging functionality. The primary problem is that the  component is stuck on Loading conversations... despite the backend API for messages being confirmed as functional. Recent console logs confirmed that mobile listings are loading correctly, shifting the focus entirely to the messaging module. Concurrently, the engineer had implemented a new ads management system, created its backend endpoints, integrated it into the frontend AdminPanel, and recently fixed issues related to MongoDB ObjectId serialization and ensuring ads are inactive by default upon creation. The current investigation is centered on the frontend's interaction with  for messages, specifically whether the user ID is being correctly passed.
