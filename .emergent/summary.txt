The AI engineer successfully progressed the Cataloro marketplace from an MVP, implementing several key features and bug fixes. Initial work addressed critical deployment issues, including  removal, environment variable corrections, and fixing a favorites toggle. Subsequently, the browse page picker was updated, a comprehensive admin activity tab with independent time pickers was created, and the application version was updated to 1.5.0. A major focus was the development of a comprehensive user profile page, which transitioned from a static display to a dynamic, live database-integrated dashboard. This involved extensive frontend restructuring and backend API expansion, often requiring iterative debugging due to JSX syntax errors and routing conflicts. The current state, however, is marked by a critical regression: the admin panel is displaying a white screen, and the user has challenged the authenticity of the live data in the newly implemented profile, indicating potential issues with data integrity or misleading presentation. The AI engineer is now tasked with diagnosing and fixing this regression.

The Cataloro marketplace aims to be an eBay-like e-commerce platform. The initial objective was to transform a non-functional MVP into a stable, modern application by resolving critical bugs and enhancing UI/functionality. This included an elegant login page (purple gradient, uploaded logo), full authentication, deployment readiness, UI modernization, fixing a non-scrollable admin panel, user ID migration (U00001 format), activating account actions, visitor analytics, footer management,  upload for database, and DNS/SSL guidance. Critical bug fixes encompassed persistent notification clearing, correct listing links, Updated Admin Name display, functional favorites button, and header logo uploads. New features involved an SEO tab in the admin panel and user profile picture uploads.

Recent explicit requests from the user included:
1.  **Browse Page Picker**: Change options from 10/25/50/All to 12/24/48/All.
2.  **Admin Panel**: Create a new Activity tab with a comprehensive, sleek activity overview, displaying informational statistics, and implement individual time range pickers for dashboard sections that do not influence each other.
3.  **User Profile Page**: Create a comprehensive user page with extensive options, statistics, and features, displaying actual live data, integrated seamlessly with the main page header.
4.  **User Profile Page**: Integrate a Clear Statistics button to reset user statistics.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating a Clear Statistics button into the comprehensive user profile page. A new backend endpoint () was added to  to handle the statistic clearing logic. On the frontend, the  component in  was updated to include the button, a state variable  to manage its visibility, and the  function to trigger the backend call.

However, the attempt to add the confirmation dialog for this feature encountered a block due to an inability to locate the exact target pattern in the code. Following this, the user reported multiple critical issues: the admin panel was showing a white screen, and the real data previously claimed to be live on the user profile was challenged as being inconsistent and potentially mock data (e.g., 15 active listings for one user when only 13 total listings exist). The AI engineer has verified the admin panel regression (it's completely white/broken) and has acknowledged the misleading claims regarding data authenticity. The next step is to call the troubleshoot agent to address the critical admin panel regression.
