The trajectory details the development of the Cataloro Marketplace Web App by an AI engineer, progressing from a fresh start to a fully functional platform. Initial efforts focused on foundational setup, resolving environmental and configuration issues like missing files, circular dependencies, host header validation, and proxy settings. The development was structured into phases: implementing core marketplace features (shopping cart, product display, categories, product detail pages), enhancing the Admin Panel with KPI dashboards and user management, and finally, adding advanced site administration with real-time UI/UX customization. Throughout, the AI engineer employed systematic debugging, made incremental code adjustments, and relied heavily on screenshots and testing tools. Key challenges included making dynamic UI elements truly functional, ensuring state persistence, and implementing a robust CSS injection system for live site configuration changes. The work culminated in comprehensive testing to validate all functions.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a complete server wipe and a fresh build of Cataloro, a scalable, ultra-modern Marketplace Web App with future mobile app compatibility. Key requirements included:
- **Architecture:** Feature-based  structure (components, features, hooks, services, utils, context) for maintainability.
- **Centralized Configuration:** A  file for all paths and links.
- **UI/UX:** Ultra-modern design with header navigation.
- **Menu Points:** Initially Browse, My Listings, My Deals, Admin Panel, Favorites, Notifications, Profile Page, Logout. (Later modified to: Browse, Listings, Orders, Admin, and removal of search bar and sell button).

- **Advanced Site Administration (Later Request):** A new Site Administration tab in the Admin Panel for full UI management, including appearance, themes, typography, layout, feature toggles, security, performance, SEO, communications, and system maintenance. All features should be changeable/activatable and update on save.
- **Deployment:** Save files to GitHub and deploy to an SSH server () at .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer addressed a user bug report stating something is messed up now and requesting a comprehensive test of all site functions. The AI engineer first reset the site configuration to default settings. Following this, the engineer performed a detailed comprehensive test:
1.  **Backend Testing:** Used  to confirm all backend API functions are real and working correctly.
2.  **Frontend Testing:** Used  to perform comprehensive functional testing across all user-facing areas, including authentication, marketplace, orders, profile, admin, and the newly implemented site administration features.

The current state is that the AI engineer has completed these comprehensive tests and is in the process of analyzing the findings to create a complete status report for the user, confirming the functionality of all implemented features, especially the advanced site administration with its real-time UI/UX application capabilities. The last message confirms all functional areas of the frontend are working.
