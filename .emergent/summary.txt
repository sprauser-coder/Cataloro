The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Cataloro marketplace from MVP to a deployment-ready state, primarily focusing on fixing critical deployment bugs on a self-hosted AlmaLinux 8.10 VPS. The work involved extensive troubleshooting of Python dependency conflicts ( and ), Nginx configuration complexities (conflicting server blocks, include directives, and WebSocket headers), and critical SELinux permissions. The AI engineer iteratively provided step-by-step commands for the user to execute on their VPS, diagnosing and resolving issues ranging from local API connectivity to external server accessibility. The primary challenge was the iterative nature of debugging a remote, user-controlled environment and resolving cascading configuration issues, with persistent SSH session freezing. The application's backend and frontend are now fully functional and accessible via the VPS IP, with the final task for the user being external DNS configuration.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like e-commerce platform for cash transactions, intentionally designed without payment integrations. Key features include user roles (buyer/seller), product listings, cart, order management, and reviews. Branding is Cataloro, with an 8-tab admin panel (Dashboard, Users, Listings, Orders, Appearance, Page Management, General Settings, Database) and a CMS for site settings and dynamic pages. User IDs are auto-generated and sequential. Image uploads are supported for logos (PNG) and listings (up to 3, PNG/JPEG). The hero section height is configurable via the admin panel, and all currency symbols are set to â‚¬. The overarching goal is the successful deployment of this application to  (IP: 217.154.0.82) on a self-hosted AlmaLinux 8.10 server.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on resolving critical deployment issues to make the Cataloro marketplace accessible at . The AI engineer and user collaboratively debugged the AlmaLinux 8.10 VPS setup.

Key problems addressed include:
1.  **Python Dependency Incompatibility**: The Pydantic (1.8.2) and  (1.1.3) versions were incompatible with Python 3.11.13, causing the FastAPI backend to crash. This was resolved by explicitly upgrading  to  (among other backend packages) and  to  within the Python virtual environment.
2.  **Hardcoded Frontend URLs**: The  file contained hardcoded  URLs for image display, preventing it from connecting to the production backend. These were replaced with .
3.  **Environment Variable Misconfiguration**: Both  and  files were updated on the VPS to contain production-ready URLs and settings (e.g., , ).
4.  **Nginx Configuration Conflicts**: The primary Nginx configuration () had a  block that was intercepting requests meant for . This was resolved by modifying both  (removing  from the default block) and  (setting it as the ). Additionally, the  directive in  was misplaced and corrected to be within the  block.
5.  **SELinux Permissions**: Nginx was returning a 403 Forbidden error for frontend assets due to incorrect SELinux context on  directory and its contents. This was fixed by running , which set the context to . SELinux was also configured to allow HTTPD network connections to the backend with .
6.  **Nginx WebSocket Headers**: An Unsupported upgrade request error occurred due to unnecessary WebSocket upgrade headers in the Nginx proxy configuration, which were removed from .

The application's backend API now consistently returns  both locally on the VPS and via Nginx proxy using the  header. The frontend React application loads successfully when accessed via the VPS's IP address () in a browser, displaying the login panel.

The persistent challenge was user interaction on the VPS, including SSH session freezing and command execution errors. This required the AI to provide highly granular, one-step-at-a-time instructions. All server-side deployment issues have been resolved.
