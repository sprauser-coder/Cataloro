The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on resolving UI/UX bugs and enhancing administrative features for the Cataloro Marketplace. Initial efforts involved debugging a Completed Transactions tab in the Admin Panel, which was resolved after backend testing. A significant portion addressed the visibility and management of Buy and Sell menu items in the Admin Panel's menu settings, necessitating fixes for database overrides and updating both desktop and mobile menu configurations in the backend. Subsequent tasks, driven by direct user feedback, involved styling corrections: changing active navigation button colors to grey, removing a duplicate Create New Listing button, and matching the user icon's color to the application's logo. The approach was iterative, employing direct code modifications and leveraging automated testing tools to validate changes.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace requires continuous improvement for its MVP, encompassing bug fixes, design enhancements, and feature additions for both mobile and desktop users.

**Key product requirements addressed and partially implemented:**

1.  **Mobile UI/UX Refinements:** Ensure mobile/desktop parity, fix mobile tab layouts, improve responsiveness, and align navigation. Specific issues included notification badge blinking, Congratulations! tender message, profile tab responsiveness, mobile user button navigation to profile, and View Public Profile menu item for mobile.
2.  **Messaging & Notification Functionality:** Mark messages as read, add unread indicators, synchronize message counts, and implement specific notification routing rules for various transaction and admin events. Ensure Mark all as read persistence.
3.  **Profile Management & Statistics:** Display real user statistics, implement password change, data export, soft account deletion, and dynamic registration date display. Refine public profile details (e.g., simplified recent listings, smaller verified badge, correct account status, Member Since date, First Name + Last Name @username display). Implement functional profile picture upload with immediate UI update.
4.  **UI Consistency & Localization:** Delete My Bids icon on Desktop Browse Page. Add number dividers for Euro figures. Redesign tender result card. Decrease Completion Details column size in Admin Panel > Completed Transactions and add info button. Use username instead of full name on Main Page top right. Update admin menu settings for active/inactive items (e.g., inventory, Buy, Sell), and control visibility for user groups. Change active navigation button color (e.g., SELL) to light gray. Remove duplicate Create New Listing buttons. Change user icon color to match logo.

-   **Frontend**: React (Hooks, Context API, React Router), Tailwind CSS (responsive design), Axios (API calls),  (timezone handling),  (currency formatting),  (PDF generation).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (Motor, UUIDs), JWT (authentication).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.
-   **Data Handling**: Partner visibility, real-time expiration, user data synchronization, notification persistence, role-based access, database overrides.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a MERN-like stack: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, all running in a Kubernetes environment. Backend API routes are prefixed with .



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Core backend API routes and business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Modified default menu items for desktop (added Buy, Sell, disabled Inventory) and  to clear database overrides. Updated the  configuration to include Buy, Sell, and Inventory items for the admin panel.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS styling, including utility classes.
    -   **Changes**:  was noted as purple-blue, relevant for identifying the duplicate Create New Listing button.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Admin interface for managing menu items.
    -   **Changes**: Updated role access buttons (A/M/S/B) active state styling from light blue to light gray ().
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Desktop header navigation and user display.
    -   **Changes**: Active navigation link styling updated from blue (, , blue gradients) to grey (, , grey gradients). The user avatar's background gradient was changed from cyan/blue to match the logo's dark blue ().
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Central admin interface, manages completed transactions.
    -   **Changes**: Investigated for  permission logic for the Completed Transactions tab.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented a fix to change the color of the user icon on the top navigation. The user had requested this icon (represented by an S in a picture) to match the dark blue color of the application's logo. The AI located the user avatar styling in  (lines 1142-1145) and updated its background gradient from a cyan/blue () to the logo's dark blue gradient (). This change was successfully applied, and the services were restarted. This work followed prior UI fixes, including changing active navigation button colors to light grey and removing a duplicate Create New Listing button, all in response to user feedback. The current state reflects these recent visual adjustments.
