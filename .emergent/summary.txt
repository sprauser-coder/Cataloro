The trajectory details the transition of the application from a state with a persistent white screen and login issues to a fully functional and deployable marketplace. Initially, the AI engineer addressed a white screen issue stemming from a JavaScript runtime error, ultimately resolving it to allow the login page to render. Following this, the user reported a new login failure. The AI identified that environment variables ( and ) had been inadvertently reset or were incorrect, causing the login malfunction. The engineer promptly corrected these environment variables in both  and , rebuilt the frontend, and restarted all services. Comprehensive testing confirmed that the login functionality was fully restored, allowing successful authentication with admin credentials. Finally, the user requested preparation for deployment, which the AI completed by verifying all production configurations and functionalities.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like e-commerce platform with buyer/seller roles and administrative features. The core objective is to achieve a stable and modern application, starting with critical bug fixes and then enhancing the UI and functionality. Key features already implemented include a dashboard, user statistics, dynamic typography, CMS, and profile management. The immediate problem addressed was a white screen issue preventing the frontend from rendering, followed by resolving login failures. The user explicitly requested fixing login on , implementing an elegant new login page (purple gradient, uploaded logo), and restoring full authentication. The final request was to prepare the application for deployment once these fixes were confirmed.

<current_work>
The application has successfully transitioned from a non-rendering white screen state to a fully functional and deployable marketplace. Initially, the white screen issue was resolved, allowing the login page to display. However, a subsequent login failure was identified due to incorrect environment variables. Specifically,  in  was pointing to a debug URL, and  in  did not include the production frontend URL. These were corrected to  for the frontend URL and updated CORS origins. After rebuilding the frontend and restarting all services, login functionality was fully restored. The application now successfully loads the login page, allows users to log in with admin credentials (/), and navigates to the dashboard, displaying Welcome to Cataloro! and Your role: admin. Backend APIs are confirmed to be operational, and the entire system is verified as ready for production deployment.
