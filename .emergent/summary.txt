The AI engineer's work on the Cataloro Marketplace Web App has been characterized by iterative development and meticulous bug fixing, primarily focused on UI/UX enhancements and core feature expansion. Initially, the engineer addressed a comprehensive list of styling bugs across the Admin Panel, My Listings, and Deals pages, applying a consistent ultra-modern and glassmorphism design, including light/dark mode compatibility. Key feature additions included a fully functional Profile Page, a robust Listings Management system in the Admin Panel, and a dual light/dark mode logo upload system with dynamic header integration.

Significant effort was dedicated to refining visual elements through user feedback, notably adjusting the opacity of dropdown menus and systematically removing all hover and transition animations from the Admin Panel. A major architectural change was transforming the Browse Page's hero section to be fully customizable via the Admin Panel, allowing editable text, height adjustment, and an image upload feature. The engineer also implemented full CRUD functionality for product listings, including a dedicated creation page and backend API endpoints. A persistent challenge throughout has been the session persistence issue, often requiring re-login during visual testing. The last task involved adding a customizable search placeholder to the Browse page's hero section.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro application aims to be an ultra-modern Marketplace Web App with a scalable architecture. Initial requirements included a feature-based  structure, centralized configuration via , and an ultra-modern UI/UX with header navigation (Browse, Listings, Orders, Admin, Profile, Logout). Core pages like listings with tile patterns, a deals page, and a functional Profile page were required. The Admin Panel was to include KPIs, user management, and advanced site administration for UI customization, with changes applying on save.

Subsequent modifications involved implementing a glassmorphism header, adding a Listings Page to the Admin Panel for comprehensive listing management (view, create, edit, bulk actions), and an editable footer configurable through Site Administration. A major redesign shifted the entire application to an ultra-modern, slightly colorful aesthetic. Ongoing bug fixes targeted inconsistencies in light/dark mode, glassmorphism application, and general formatting across Admin Dashboard, User Management, Listings Management, My Listings, Deals, and Site Administration buttons. The Browse page hero section was explicitly requested to be editable, full-width, with height adjustment, and an image upload, replacing static content with a search bar and restoring filter functionalities. The ability to create listings via various buttons was also a core feature request.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the functionality to make the **search placeholder text** in the **Browse Page's hero section editable** via the Admin Panel.

The user explicitly requested: Give me also the option to change the placeholder text in the hero selection submit field in the admin panel hero selection settings (Chat Message 523).

The AI engineer addressed this by:
1.  **Updating  (in )**:
    *   Added a new input field within the Hero Selection tab for .
    *   Updated the component's state and save logic to manage this new property.
    *   Ensured the live preview within the Admin Panel correctly reflects the dynamic placeholder.
2.  **Updating **:
    *   Modified the  state to include .
    *   Updated the search input field in the hero section to use this dynamic  value.

At the point of this summary request, the code changes were successfully applied to the frontend, the frontend service was restarted, and the AI engineer was about to take a screenshot to verify the new search placeholder setting in the Admin Panel (). The work ensures that administrators can now customize the prompt text displayed in the primary search bar of the marketplace's landing page.
