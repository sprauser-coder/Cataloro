The trajectory details a dynamic, iterative development cycle for the Cataloro Marketplace. Initially, the AI engineer addressed a critical bug where seller  status was incorrect on browse page listings, fixing it by updating the admin user's profile and verifying backend data consistency. Following this, a comprehensive buy/sell transaction system was implemented, including backend order management, frontend Buy Now functionality with visual feedback, a new Pending Sales page, and integration into the shopping cart and navigation. Significant effort was also directed at enhancing the messaging system with real-time features, unread counts, and UI adjustments. The latest work involved refining the notification system to add quick actions and ensure the View All Notifications page functions correctly, but this task was still in progress, ending with a frontend script error during visual verification.

The Cataloro Marketplace, a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application, aims to provide a robust platform for buying and selling. It started with a modern UI (glassmorphism, responsiveness) and core CRUD for listings, user profiles, and admin capabilities. Features expanded to include a Cat Database for admin, live messaging, favorites, and cart management. Numerous bugs were resolved, such as profile dark mode, invisible UI elements, and price displays. Recent additions included market price suggestions, detailed address fields, and comprehensive business account settings with dynamic Private/Business badges. The current development introduced a full buy/sell transaction workflow: a Buy Now button, seller notification for purchase requests (48-hour approval limit, first-come-first-served), item status change to sold upon acceptance, removal from browse, order tracking for both parties, option to change status, pending items in buyer's cart, chat trigger post-approval, and a Pending Sales section for sellers. Messaging was enhanced with new message popups, reversed message order, and unread counts. Notification system needed quick actions and a functional View All Notifications page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several critical user feedback points related to the messaging and notification systems. Specifically, the user reported that the Notifications Page was not appearing, lacked actions, and the notification dropdown in the header did not feature quick actions. The AI engineer previously modified  and  in an attempt to rectify these issues, as well as ensure the View All Notifications link was functional. The last recorded action was a  call which resulted in a , indicating a fundamental frontend issue preventing the page from loading correctly for visual verification. The current state is that the notification system is believed to have backend support, but its frontend display and interactivity are still broken, and the root cause of the  is unknown.
