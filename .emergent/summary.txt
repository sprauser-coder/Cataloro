The AI engineer successfully transformed the Cataloro Marketplace, initially focusing on advanced search, social commerce, and critical bug fixes in notifications, deals, profiles, and admin panels. A major recent undertaking was the implementation of a comprehensive tender/bidding system, replacing Buy Now with Offer functionality across browse and product detail pages, complete with buyer confirmation. Significant effort was also dedicated to resolving a persistent  related to login, which was eventually traced to CORS configuration and environment variable usage, requiring multiple iterations of fixes and robust testing. Navigation was restructured to unify tender management, and smart notification routing was added. The latest work focused on ensuring seller and tender offerer information is correctly displayed in the tender management views, which required backend data enrichment and frontend display logic adjustments, and is currently in the final stages of verification.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace, from an MVP, aims to be a modern buying/selling platform. Initial requirements included CRUD for listings/users, admin tools, UI/UX, messaging, and notification systems. Recent key features implemented:
1.  **Login/Info Pages:** Redesigned login and dynamic Info Page driven by a CMS (SEO, dynamic sections, image management).
2.  **Advanced Search & Discovery:** AI-powered search, filters, recommendations for a catalyst marketplace.
3.  **Enhanced Social Commerce:** Review and rating system for catalysts.
4.  **Notifications System Extension:** Dedicated  page, and Admin Panel for managing toast notifications (CRUD, triggers, timing, targeting).
5.  **Live Deals Dashboard:**  page redesigned for real-time transaction data and statistics.
6.  **Public Profile Enhancement:** Dynamic, real user data display with consistent spacing.
7.  **Admin Panel Listings Management:** Active, Pending, Inactive, Sold tabs show live data.

**Current Major Requirement: Tender/Bidding System:**
-   Replace Buy Now with a price input and Offer button on listing tiles.
-   Buyers submit tenders; sellers get an overview per listing and choose a winner.
-   Losing bidders get notifications; winning bidder gets automated message and notification.
-   Tenders remain active until seller decision.
-   Minimum bid must not be smaller than the current highest bid.
-   Support multiple tender offers.
-   Seller can accept/reject tenders.
-   Visible confirmation after a buyer submits an offer.
-   On individual listing pages, the tender system should replace Add to Cart.
-   My Tender Offers should show real seller per tender.
-   My Listings should include a Closed Listings tile for sold/closed items.
-   My Deals page to be deleted.
-   Shopping cart to be repurposed as a comprehensive overview of ongoing/finished processes (deferred).
-   Tenders navigation: One page with two tabs (Manage Tenders, My Tenders) instead of a dropdown.
-   On Tenders Management, individual tenders must show the tender offerer.
-   Admin menu should be the last item in the header, always highlighted yellow/orange.
-   Smart notification click handlers: Tender Accepted → My Tenders; New Tender Offer → Manage Tenders (with specific tender open); Order Completed → My Listings (Closed); New Message → Messages (respective message).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug report from the user: On tenders management tenders = Does not show the tender offerer.

**Investigation:**
1.  The AI engineer first examined  and confirmed that the frontend code () was designed to display buyer information.
2.  Initial screenshots showed no active tenders, preventing direct verification of the bug.
3.  Backend API () was tested, revealing that it was not correctly populating buyer information due to missing ObjectId fallback logic and general buyer lookup issues.

**Fix Implemented:**
1.  In , the  endpoint and related buyer lookup functions were updated.
2.  The ObjectId fallback logic was added, and the buyer information retrieval was corrected to ensure that  and  are properly included in the response for tender offers.
3.  The backend service was restarted to apply these changes.

**Current Status:**
-   The backend fix has been implemented and tested, confirming that the API now correctly returns comprehensive buyer (offerer) information with each tender.
-   Frontend tests have confirmed that seller information is now visible on listing cards within the Manage Tenders tab.
-   However, to verify the specific user-reported issue (tender offerer visibility for *individual* tenders), new tender offers need to be submitted.
-   The AI engineer has just successfully created 6 new tender offers via backend testing and is poised to re-test the frontend to confirm the display of individual tender offerer information.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the frontend to verify that the tender offerer information is now displayed correctly for individual tenders in the Manage Tenders section.
