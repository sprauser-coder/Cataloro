The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Cataloro marketplace from an initial state of white screen and login failures to a fully functional application. Key early achievements included resolving JavaScript runtime errors and correcting environment variables (, ) to restore login. However, a persistent and critical challenge throughout the development has been an infrastructure-level caching layer that frequently prevents the browser from receiving the most up-to-date frontend code. This necessitated repeated, aggressive cache-busting and direct manipulation of served JavaScript files. Despite this, the AI diligently implemented numerous user-requested features, including an SEO admin tab, user profile picture uploads, and fixing navigation links. The current phase is focused on resolving lingering issues related to notification clearing, image previews/display, and individual listing navigation, all of which are continuously hampered by the pervasive caching problem.

The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like e-commerce platform with buyer, seller, and admin roles. The user's primary goal is a stable, modern application, beginning with critical bug fixes and then enhancing UI and functionality. Existing features include a dashboard, user statistics, dynamic typography, CMS, and profile management.
Initial critical issues: a white screen and login failures on .
Explicit requests included:
- Implement an elegant new login page (purple gradient, uploaded logo).
- Restore full authentication.
- Prepare the application for deployment.
- Modernize UI/styling, implement messaging, fix admin panel layout (non-scrollable), and migrate user IDs.
- Activate account actions, integrate visitor analytics, implement footer management.
- Implement  upload for database management.
- Guide on DNS/SSL.
- Crucially, fix: Notifications should clear after actions (e.g., accept). My Listings Listings link not working.
- New features: SEO tab in admin panel (site title, favicon, prompts), user profile picture upload.
- Restore the entire interface and ensure connectivity on both development and server environments, with comprehensive testing.
- Address issues: user profile access, Updated Admin Name display, non-functional favorites button, header logo not uploading.
- Ensure individual listings are clickable and navigate to detail pages.
- Fix hero image display on main page and preview in admin.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing three main issues, all of which are deeply intertwined with persistent infrastructure-level caching preventing the latest frontend code from being served:

1.  **Notifications Not Clearing (Notification Center)**: Despite implementing logic in  to clear notifications after actions (e.g., Approve) and verifying the backend APIs for marking notifications as read are functional, the frontend is still showing notifications persisting in the dropdown. The AI discovered that the built JavaScript *contains* the fix, but the browser isn't loading this updated file due to caching.

2.  **Listing Image Upload/Preview/Display**: The user reported that images uploaded for listings are not showing previews in the Create New Listing form and are not displaying on the listings themselves. The AI has confirmed that the backend upload functionality works, and files are stored. A critical part of the fix involved creating a new FastAPI endpoint  in  to route image requests through the API gateway, and updating the  helper in  to use this new API route. While product images are now displaying correctly using , the caching issue means the new  is not consistently used for all image types.

3.  **Hero Image Not Displaying/Previewing**: Similar to listing images, the hero image uploaded via the admin panel's Hero Selection tab is not displaying on the main page and its preview is not working in the admin panel. The backend successfully uploads and serves these images via . The  function was also updated to address this, but again, the frontend caching prevents the correct image URLs from being used.

The AI's latest actions involve applying DIRECT JAVASCRIPT FIXES by manipulating the served JavaScript files and investigating why the built code with fixes isn't consistently taking effect in the browser. The persistent caching has made it necessary to directly modify the deployed JavaScript assets, which yielded partial success for product images.
