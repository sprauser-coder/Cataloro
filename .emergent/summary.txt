The provided trajectory details a significant development phase for the Cataloro Marketplace. Initially, the system inherited work from a previous AI engineer, which included restoring the Admin Panel, implementing dynamic price range configuration, adding time limits for listings, and various UI/UX improvements and bug fixes, notably the newest first sorting issue. The current AI engineer then took over, responding to new user requests. These involved refining the messaging system by removing the new message function and implementing auto-deletion for inactive chats, restructuring the Tenders Management page into Sell and Buy tabs, fixing a UI visibility bug in Profile Settings, and integrating an HTML editor for the About page within the Admin Panel's Content Management System. The work was completed iteratively, including self-corrections for lint errors and missing components, with backend functionality verified, and the system awaiting user confirmation for frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace requires expansion from its MVP state with new features and UI/UX refinements.
1.  **Admin Panel:** Full restoration with dynamic price range configuration, user management (create, edit, delete), and visual confirmations for saves. Recently, an HTML editor for the About page was added under Site Administration Management.
2.  **Listing Management:** Implement optional, extendable time limits for listings, displaying a countdown. Display  date. A Listings Management tab was to be added to Tenders Management, which has now been merged into a Sell tab alongside a new Buy tab for all given tenders.
3.  **Marketplace Display:**
    *   **Browse Tiles:** Display time remaining as a badge, show active/highest bids, reorder tile layout, change inactive input placeholder to Bid..., and ensure newest first sorting.
    *   **Individual Listing Page:** Reflect tile functionalities, prune unused elements (Rating, Condition, Stock, Shipping, Features/Reviews), show initial seller's price, auto-update price on tender, implement a two-column layout, place bids/runtime under listed date, remove description from below price, and remove sharing button.
4.  **User Experience:** Remove Message Seller button, reduce hover animation intensity. The New Message function was recently removed from the Messaging page, and chats now auto-delete after 7 days of inactivity.
5.  **Profile Settings:** Update profile settings to match original codebase. A recent fix addressed checkbox visibility in light mode.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented several new user requests. The New Message function was completely removed from , and logic for auto-deleting inactive chats after 7 days was added. The  was significantly refactored: the previous Tender Management and Listings Management tabs were merged into a new  component, and a new  was created to display all user-given tenders. This involved updating header button logic, tab navigation, and content rendering, and correcting a  import error by recreating the component. A UI issue in Profile Settings (likely in  or ) was resolved, making the account type switch checkbox visible in light mode. Lastly, an HTML editor for the About page was added to the Admin Panel within , requiring updates to the  array,  state, and the addition of a  function. Backend changes were tested and passed. Frontend changes are awaiting user confirmation for testing.

<optional_next_step>
Await user confirmation to proceed with automated frontend testing to verify the recently implemented features.
