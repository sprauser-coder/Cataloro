The AI engineer's work trajectory commenced with a foundational fix for a performance bottleneck on the mobile browse page, stemming from massive base64 image payloads. This involved a multi-stage optimization of image handling, transitioning from direct base64 storage to file-based storage and thumbnail generation, and refining the  endpoint. Subsequent efforts systematically tackled performance and functional bugs across the application. This included addressing N+1 query problems in messaging and tenders backend endpoints, resolving React hooks violations in the mobile messenger, rectifying inconsistent user ID handling affecting bidding, ensuring accurate price displays across mobile and desktop views, and fixing frontend UI bugs like desktop messenger scrolling and missing admin panel icons. The work demonstrated a rigorous debugging approach, iterating through user feedback to achieve a more robust and performant application, particularly on mobile.

The Cataloro Marketplace required restoration and enhancement, with a primary focus on mobile UI/UX, addressing several critical issues and feature additions. This included a complete mobile UI/UX redesign, encompassing icon errors, navigation, streamlined menus, fixing hero section text cutoff, styling the + button, and removing Hot Deals and Message Now sections. A full-screen mobile messenger with real-time data, auto-scroll, and always-visible input was crucial. Mobile listings needed to be clickable, with optimized detail views and integrated bidding. A new admin-activated ads system was also required. Persistent issues like the 0 catalysts available bug, search enhancements, basket export feedback, slow fetching, phantom listings (caching), and general responsiveness were to be resolved. Recent refinements included bid success notifications, real-time price updates reflecting highest bids, removal of dummy striked-off prices, and preventing auto-focus in the messenger. A significant performance bottleneck in  due to large image payloads also needed urgent attention. So far, the AI engineer has implemented significant performance optimizations for listing browsing, bidding, and messaging, fixed critical UI issues, and addressed data inconsistencies.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to enhance the mobile browse view. The user specifically asked to add a quick bid input field to the mobile listings overview and to include a market range display, similar to the desktop version. Additionally, the user requested to remove any unnecessary additional info from the overview page to streamline the mobile UI.

The AI engineer's current action involves understanding the existing market range functionality in the desktop version. The analysis has revealed that the desktop's  calculates and displays a market range for catalyst items based on price suggestions from a Cat Database. The AI engineer is now examining  to determine the necessary modifications for integrating these new features and cleaning up the UI.
