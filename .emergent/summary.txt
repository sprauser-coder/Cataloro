<product_requirements>
The Cataloro application is a modern marketplace web app with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Initially, it required a modern UI/UX with glassmorphism, responsiveness, and consistent navigation. Core features included product listing (CRUD, bulk actions), a deals page, and user profiles. The Admin Panel manages users and listings. Subsequent requirements expanded to include UI/UX improvements (light/dark mode, spacing), a Cat Database for admin with Excel upload, price calculation, and listing creation integration (autocomplete, calculated prices, ). Live features like messaging, favorites, and cart management were implemented. Numerous bugs were addressed, including profile dark mode, favorites page updates, invisible UI elements, price display, listing visibility, image clickability, and backend data inconsistencies. Quantity controls were removed across the app (one product per listing), and currency was standardized to Euro. More recent additions involved market price suggestions (ranges), detailed address fields in profiles with conditional display on listing creation, location/country suggestions, business account settings (Company Name, Country, VAT Number) with Private/Business badges, and ensuring persistence of all profile changes.
