The trajectory details an extensive, iterative development process for the Cataloro Marketplace. Initially, the AI engineer tackled a critical bug related to incorrect  status on product listings, which was fixed in the backend and verified. This was followed by implementing a comprehensive buy/sell transaction system, including backend order management, a Buy Now frontend feature, and a Pending Sales page, integrating these into existing navigation and the shopping cart. Significant work went into enhancing the messaging system with real-time features and UI adjustments. The notification system was then extensively refactored to include quick actions, real-time polling, and animation, despite initial frontend script errors and login flow issues which were eventually resolved.

Subsequent development focused on user feedback and new features: fixing the My Deals section not updating (resolved by correcting backend data source), adding a Business tab to the Admin Panel with a visual process map, and resolving admin panel tab overflow issues. The notification dropdown received a redesign with icon buttons and auto-delete functionality. More recently, the AI engineer addressed a broad set of enhancements covering public profile pages (with real user data and interactions), messenger UI cleanup (removing visible boxes, adding delete options), a complete redesign of the Notifications Page, and renaming Orders to Deals throughout the application. The current effort is fixing lingering bugs in the Public Profile (showing dummy data) and notification page button alignment, with the AI engineer actively working on these.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace facilitates buying and selling with a modern UI, offering CRUD for listings, profiles, and admin tools. Key features include a Cat Database, live messaging, favorites, and cart. Initial fixes addressed profile dark mode, UI visibility, and pricing. Recent updates brought market price suggestions, detailed addresses, and business account settings. The core feature implemented is a buy/sell transaction workflow: a Buy Now button, seller notifications (48-hour approval, first-come-first-served), item status change to sold, order tracking, status change options, pending items in the buyer's cart, chat initiation post-approval, and a Pending Sales section for sellers. Messaging gained new popups, reversed order, and unread counts. The notification system requires quick actions and a functional View All Notifications page. Further, the user requested a Public Profile Page, messenger UI enhancements (removing video/call icons, adding delete, fixing visible box), a Create Draft button for listings, removal of the Sold tile from My Listings, correct functioning and sorting for My Deals, and admin panel sub-tabs for listings (Active/Pending/Inactive/Sold).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical bugs reported by the user after a comprehensive set of enhancements. The user reported the Public Profile Page was incorrectly showing sash_admin for all profiles instead of specific user credentials and contained dummy data instead of real interactions. The Messenger still had a visible box around it, the View All Notifications link led to a dead site, the Notifications Page itself needed redesign, and the My Deals page required more functionality and correct deal information.

The AI engineer has begun systematically fixing these issues. Specifically, they have already made edits to  to fetch real user data (Chat 427) and ensure the interactions also use real data (Chat 429). The next explicit task the AI engineer mentioned was to address the Notification Buttons Alignment (Chat 430), indicating they are in the process of fixing the UI issues on the redesigned Notifications Page.
