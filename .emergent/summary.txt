The AI engineer's work trajectory commenced with critical performance fixes, transitioning image handling and optimizing the  endpoint. Subsequent efforts systematically resolved N+1 query issues in messaging, rectified React hooks violations, and ensured consistent user ID handling, particularly for bidding and price displays. Extensive UI/UX improvements focused on mobile, including a redesign of My Listings, addition of a Tenders section, and fixing bottom navigation overlaps. Key challenges involved debugging data consistency for admin listings due to  mismatches, which required backend ID resolution. A full system audit addressed severe performance bottlenecks, MongoDB misconfigurations, missing indexes, and memory leaks through database optimizations and endpoint pagination. The mobile tenders page was updated to align with desktop data, and mobile-optimized inline tender management with accept/reject functionality was added. The login area received an ultra-modern liquid glass redesign, integrating an admin-uploaded logo and removing fast-login options. A consolidated mobile search bar with filters was implemented. Most recently, a comprehensive Menu Settings system for the admin panel, allowing role-based visibility control for both mobile and desktop navigation, was built and integrated. The immediate task involves fixing critical security vulnerabilities in admin endpoints, which were found to be accessible without authentication.

The Cataloro Marketplace required a significant overhaul, particularly for mobile UI/UX, to enhance performance and functionality. Initial explicit requests included fixing base64 image payload bottlenecks, resolving N+1 queries, addressing React hooks violations, and ensuring consistent user ID handling for bidding and pricing. A primary focus was a complete mobile UI/UX redesign: fixing icon errors, improving navigation, streamlining menus, resolving hero section text cutoff, styling the + button, and removing Hot Deals and Message Now sections. A full-screen mobile messenger with real-time data, auto-scroll, and always-visible input was crucial. Mobile listings needed to be clickable, offer optimized detail views, and integrate bidding. An admin-activated ads system was also required. Persistent issues like the 0 catalysts available bug, search enhancements, basket export feedback, slow fetching, phantom listings, and general responsiveness were targets for resolution. Recent additions encompassed bid success notifications, real-time price updates, removal of dummy prices, and preventing messenger auto-focus. The AI engineer has successfully implemented mobile quick bidding, market range display, real-time bid updates, improved navigation, addressed user ID inconsistencies, and populated demo data. The most recent requirements include an ultra-modern login redesign with an admin-uploaded logo, no hover effects, and a comprehensive admin menu settings system with role-based visibility toggles for both mobile and desktop menus.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that the Menu Settings in the admin panel were failing to load.
The AI initially performed backend testing of the menu settings API endpoints, which showed they were functioning correctly. This suggested a frontend issue. Upon reviewing the frontend code in  and , the AI identified and fixed a URL construction error where a redundant  prefix was being added, leading to 404 errors.
After attempting to verify the fix by navigating to the admin panel, the application redirected back to the login page, indicating a deeper problem. A subsequent comprehensive backend security audit, initiated by the AI engineer, uncovered **critical security vulnerabilities**: admin endpoints were found to be accessible without authentication (returning 200 OK instead of 401/403), invalid tokens were accepted, and incorrect passwords allowed login. This fundamental security flaw is the root cause of the unexpected frontend behavior and the current focus of the work. The AI engineer has explicitly stated, Let me fix these critical security issues first by adding proper authentication to the admin endpoints. This is the precise state of work.
