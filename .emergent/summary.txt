The AI engineer successfully addressed two major concerns. Initially, a critical bug was reported where all users saw identical data in their profile panels. The engineer meticulously debugged the backend, discovering duplicate  API routes in  and an underlying issue where database queries incorrectly used  instead of  for fetching order statistics. This was rectified to ensure individual, authentic user data. Following this, the user requested deployment readiness. The engineer configured  and  to , rebuilt the frontend, restarted services, and verified the application's functionality, including login, on the target IP. Comprehensive documentation () was created, and successful operation was confirmed with screenshots.

The Cataloro marketplace, an eBay-like e-commerce platform, aims for a stable and enhanced MVP. Initial objectives included resolving critical bugs (white screen, image issues, login failures), improving UI/UX (elegant login, UI modernization), and core feature implementation. Key features planned are a non-scrollable admin panel fix, user ID migration (), activating account actions, visitor analytics, footer management,  uploads, and DNS/SSL guidance. Bug fixes target notifications, listing links, admin name display, favorites, and header logo uploads. New features include an SEO tab and user profile picture uploads. Recent additions include an updated Browse Page Picker (12/24/48/All options), an Activity tab with statistics in the Admin Panel, a comprehensive User Profile page with live data (stats, activity, listings, orders, favorites, messages, reviews, settings), and a Clear Statistics button for user profiles.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed two main objectives: resolving a critical data display bug and preparing the application for deployment.

**1. Resolved Same Data for All Users Bug:**
The user reported that all users saw identical data in their profile panels. The AI engineer diagnosed this as a backend issue in . Two duplicate  API endpoints were found, leading to a routing conflict. More critically, the active endpoint's MongoDB queries for user order statistics incorrectly used  instead of . This caused all users to retrieve default or empty data. The fix involved updating these queries to use . This ensured that each user's profile statistics, including order count and spending, reflected their individual, real data. Backend services were restarted and verified to be working correctly with the fix.

**2. Achieved Deployment Readiness:**
Following the bug fix, the user requested the application be made ready for deployment on the real IP  (without port). The AI engineer updated the following configurations:
-   :  was set to .
-   :  was set to  and  to .
The supervisor configuration () was verified to be correctly set for production (frontend serving a build, backend on 8001). The frontend was then rebuilt using , and all services were restarted. Comprehensive deployment readiness testing was performed, confirming backend responsiveness and successful frontend connectivity and login to the admin dashboard on . A  file was created to document this validated configuration.

<optional_next_step>
The last explicit request for deployment readiness and verification has been fulfilled. The next step will be to complete the Clear Statistics button functionality, including the confirmation dialog, as listed in the pending tasks.
