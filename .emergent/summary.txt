The trajectory describes an iterative development process by an AI engineer on the Cataloro Marketplace application. Initially, the focus was on addressing bugs and implementing a per-basket PDF export feature, fixing Admin Panel UI issues, and resolving a critical PDF logo upload bug. Post-handoff, the AI engineer tackled user requests for a state-of-the-art messaging system, a comprehensive transaction-based rating system, enhanced user profiles with real data and account actions, and UI cleanups (removing currency from browse page, removing bidding/similar items from product page, enhancing PDF export buttons). After extensive backend and frontend testing, which revealed and resolved critical authentication and messaging route issues, the engineer proceeded to implement Admin Panel enhancements: consolidating the Ads Manager, adding an Edit Side Menu with drag-and-drop, and creating an Export Manager tile. The work culminated in the engineer claiming 100% completion, only for the user to immediately report a bug with the Edit Side Menu functionality, indicating it was not functional and displayed incorrect items.

The Cataloro Marketplace aims to be a scalable platform with robust inventory, role-based access, and enhanced UX. Initial development focused on core improvements, later introducing real-time, multi-currency, escrow, and AI features. The recent phase emphasized consolidating functionalities, eliminating dummy data, and adding Documentation and Media Browser to the admin panel. Specific requirements from the user included:
1.  **State-of-the-Art Messaging**: Modern, feature-rich messaging with all functionalities.
2.  **Rating System**: Backend implementation and frontend visibility/activation, allowing users to rate sellers/buyers only after a transaction, with a one-rating-per-user-pair limit.
3.  **Enhanced User Profiles**: Populating profile settings (Rating, Listings, Join Date, Statistics) with real backend data. Activating Account Actions like Export Data (PDF) and Delete Account with verification. Prohibiting existing usernames during changes.
4.  **UI Clean-up**: Removing currency from Browse page listing tiles. Removing Live Bidding and Similar Items from Individual Listings page. Enhancing Inventory > Baskets Export PDF button (visuals, loading states).
5.  **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Consolidate Admin Panel's Ads Manager. Add 'Edit Side Menu' with drag-and-drop. Create an Export Manager tile (PDF template editing).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the implementation of all requested Admin Panel enhancements. This included consolidating the Ads Manager, creating an Export Manager tile, and implementing an Edit Side Menu feature with supposed drag-and-drop functionality, as integrated into . The AI engineer had declared all 12 requested tasks (including these Admin Panel changes) as 100% complete and the application production-ready. However, the user promptly reported a critical bug concerning the Edit Side Menu feature, stating that it was not functioning and that its not the real items in the menu. This indicates the feature, though implemented, is not correctly wired up to the actual application's navigation structure or is displaying placeholder data, contradicting the AI's prior claim of full functionality. The AI engineer is now tasked with investigating and fixing this specific issue.
