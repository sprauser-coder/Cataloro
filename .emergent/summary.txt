The AI engineer has progressively developed the Cataloro Marketplace, starting from initial UI/UX refinements and foundational feature implementation. The work trajectory showcases an iterative approach, meticulously addressing user-reported bugs and expanding core functionalities. Key phases included resolving styling inconsistencies (especially in light/dark mode and glassmorphism elements), enhancing core marketplace features like listing creation and display, and introducing significant new modules such as the Cat Database.

The process involved detailed debugging, often tracing issues from UI symptoms back to backend API responses or frontend configuration mismatches. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in both React and FastAPI, modifying components, services, and backend endpoints. Notable achievements include a fully functional listing creation and browse system, a comprehensive Cat Database with Excel import and price calculation logic, and extensive UI improvements across admin and profile pages. The most recent efforts focus on activating live features and refining UI, currently debugging a scope issue for favorites functionality.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro application is envisioned as an ultra-modern Marketplace Web App with a scalable architecture, featuring a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Initial requirements included a feature-based structure, centralized configuration (), and a ultra-modern UI/UX supporting header navigation (Browse, Listings, Orders, Admin, Profile, Logout). Core functionalities like product listings (tile patterns), a deals page, and a Profile page were essential. The Admin Panel was to manage KPIs, users, and allow UI customization (e.g., editable footer, customizable Browse page hero section).

Subsequent requests included:
1.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Glassmorphism header, responsive design, consistent ultra-modern, slightly colorful aesthetic, fixing light/dark mode inconsistencies, removing hover animations from Admin Panel,  spacing.
2.  **Core Features**:
    *   Listings Page in Admin Panel for full listing management (CRUD, bulk actions).
    *   Editable Browse page hero section (full-width, height, image, search placeholder).
    *   Functional listing creation.
    *   Display of new listings in Browse and My Listings pages.
    *   Footer displaying Dark Mode Logo instead of text.
    *   My Listings and Orders pages: decrease spacing, make top 4 tiles clickable.
    *   Browse page: remove trending and fast shipping labels.
    *   My Listings link in Profile dropdown active.
3.  **Admin Enhancements**:
    *   Move Hero Selection from main Admin submenu to Site Administration tile.
    *   **Cat Database**: New admin tab with Data, Price Calculations, Basis sub-tabs. Functionality for Excel upload (10 columns, editable table,  hidden), specific price calculation formula, and input fields for basis variables (Pt/Pd/Rh price, Renumeration).
    *   Delete Database button for Cat Database.
    *   Bulk options for Admin Panel > User Management.
    *   Permanently change admin name to Sash.
4.  **Live Functionality**:
    *   Implement live messaging functionality.
    *   Implement live Add/Delete from Favorites (heart symbol on Browse page).
    *   Implement live cart functionality.
    *   Implement live notifications.
5.  **Bug Fixes**: Profile settings > Activity > Tiles light/dark mode formatting.
