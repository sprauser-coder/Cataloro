The previous AI engineer focused on comprehensive enhancements and bug fixes across the Cataloro Marketplace application, covering mobile UI/UX, data synchronization, and administrative features. The trajectory began by addressing mobile tab navigation issues and complex message read/unread badge synchronization. Key decisions involved aligning frontend calculations with backend data structures, particularly for profile statistics, and standardizing date/time handling.

Subsequent phases tackled notification routing across mobile and desktop, implementing specific redirects for various notification types. This required identifying and modifying handlers in both  and , and later  due to a mobile-specific component discrepancy. UI improvements included cleaning up browse and tender pages, and a significant effort to introduce German Euro formatting across all price displays.

The work culminated in extensive profile functionality enhancements, including working password changes, data export, soft account deletion, dynamic display of registration dates, and real-time public profile statistics. Bug fixes for date formatting and public profile accessibility were also implemented, followed by refinements to notification persistence, public profile badge displays, account status roles, recent listing formats, and avatar upload functionality. The final set of tasks involved further UI tweaks, including menu settings and ensuring mobile/desktop parity.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a new batch of 7 user requests focused on UI refinements, admin panel improvements, and ensuring mobile/desktop parity.

Specifically, the AI engineer was working on:
1.  **Recent Listings Navigation**: Made individual listings on the public profile clickable to their respective product pages ().
2.  **Public Profile Badges**: Moved badges on the public profile right next to the name ().
3.  **Tender Result Card Redesign**: Redesigned the uploaded tender result card for better organization in .
4.  **Admin Panel Completed Transactions**: Decreased the size of the Completion Details column, limited its content to Method and date, and added an info button with a modal for full transaction details in .
5.  **Main Page Header Username Display**: Changed the top-right display on the main page header to show the  instead of First Name + Last Name in .

The AI engineer implemented these five items and performed a partial frontend test. The test summary () indicated that 4 out of 5 tests passed for these implemented fixes, but did not specify which one might still have an issue. The AI engineer then decided to provide a summary of work accomplished and note what still needs attention, implying the remaining two points (menu settings update and full mobile parity check) from the last user request were not yet started or completed.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the failing fix among the last 5 implemented features, and then proceed with updating menu settings and ensuring mobile/desktop parity.
