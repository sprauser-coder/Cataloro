The previous AI engineer successfully executed a major consolidation and refactoring effort for the Cataloro Marketplace, as explicitly requested by the user. Initially, the system had grown with separate backend services and frontend components for various phases (Phase 1-6), leading to duplication and an overloaded feeling. The AI engineer systematically merged redundant backend services (analytics, security) and consolidated API endpoints. On the frontend, multiple dashboards were unified into a single Mega Unified Dashboard with internal navigation. The process also involved eliminating all dummy data, implementing a comprehensive Documentation tab, and a Media Browser for admin-uploaded files. Subsequently, the admin panel's UI was transformed into a professional left sidebar navigation, with several layout fixes to address positioning and cutoff issues. Most recently, the engineer addressed a critical issue of lost functionalities by introducing an Advanced Features tab, explained the Escrow system, and started fixing other reported bugs such as listings limits, AI features crash, and Business tab dummy data.

The Cataloro Marketplace was built incrementally, starting from an MVP, with an overarching goal for scalability, robust inventory management, role-based access control, and an enhanced user experience.

**Initial Core Improvements (Phase 0-4)**: Focused on inventory accuracy, consolidated admin roles, messaging fixes, error resolution (429), UI/UX enhancements, database optimization (indexing, Redis caching), advanced search (Elasticsearch), enhanced security (rate limiting, login protection), and business intelligence dashboards.

**Advanced Marketplace Features (Phase 5)**: Introduced real-time infrastructure (WebSockets), multi-currency support, secure escrow transactions, and AI-powered recommendations, with corresponding frontend UI.

**Enterprise Intelligence & Global Expansion (Phase 6)**: User-defined phase including advanced analytics, enhanced user management, enterprise security, AI-powered fraud detection, an AI chatbot, and internationalization, all with accompanying frontend UI.

**Current Major Requirement**: A comprehensive consolidation of the entire project to merge similar functionalities on both backend and frontend, eliminate all dummy data, ensure seamless operation, and create a Documentation tab in the admin panel with guidance, visual architecture, and infrastructure graphics. Additionally, a Media Browser for admin-uploaded images was requested. The user also raised several specific bug fixes and feature enhancements, including currency converter integration, language picker implementation, fixing AI features, activating webhooks, removing listing limits, fixing business tab dummy data, and addressing layout issues.

**Directory Structure (Reflecting latest changes):**

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Central API. Updated to import and use the new consolidated backend services (, , ). Removed old phase-specific endpoint imports. Increased the default listings limit from 20 to 100.
-   : **NEW FILE**. This file consolidates the functionalities previously found in  and , providing a single, comprehensive analytics service.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Merges  and , offering a unified approach to security and compliance.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Centralizes all API endpoints for Phase 5 and Phase 6 features, replacing  and .
-   : Main application entry. Updated its routing logic to reference the consolidated dashboards (e.g., , ), which eventually led to using a single admin route handled by .
-   : The central administrative interface.
    -   Initially updated to navigate to  and .
    -   Underwent a major refactor to integrate  as the sole dashboard component.
    -   Added new Documentation and Media Browser tabs.
    -   Transformed from a horizontal tab-based navigation to a professional left-sidebar navigation.
    -   Fixed multiple layout issues including sidebar overlap, content cutoff, and height adjustments for compactness ( -> ,  ->  for list items, header height reduction).
    -   Integrated  to restore access to currency, language, escrow, AI, and webhooks administration.
    -   Implemented CSS to hide the footer when in the admin panel.
    -   Fixed missing  import which was causing AI features to crash.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Cat's Horizontal Scrolling**: Fix layout width issues in the Cat's Calculation section to eliminate horizontal scrolling.
-   **Integrate Currency Converter**: Apply  to individual listings and other relevant app functionalities.
-   **Integrate Language Switcher**: Add  to the main header navigation for global translation.
-   **Make Webhooks Active**: Create the necessary UI and backend logic to activate and manage webhooks.
-   **Test Browse Page**: Verify that the browse page now correctly displays all listings (more than 20) after the backend limit increase.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a series of critical bug fixes and feature implementations stemming from the user's latest feedback. The engineer has made significant progress in addressing several key issues:

1.  **AI Features Crash (FIXED)**: The  import was missing in , causing the AI Features section to crash. This has been resolved, and the AI Features dashboard is now fully functional, displaying its four sections (AI Recommendations, AI Chatbot, Fraud Detection, Predictive Analytics).
2.  **Listings Limit (FIXED)**: The backend  was limiting the number of listings shown on the browse page to 20. This default limit has been increased to 100, ensuring more listings are displayed.
3.  **Business Tab Dummy Data (IN PROGRESS)**: The  component was using hardcoded dummy data. A new  function has been created to retrieve actual analytics data from the unified analytics endpoints, replacing the mock metrics.
4.  **Currency Converter Integration (CREATED)**: A new component, , has been created to handle real-time currency conversion for prices, ready to be integrated into individual listings and other relevant parts of the application.
5.  **Language Switcher (CREATED)**: A new  component has been developed to enable global language selection and site-wide translation, awaiting integration into the main application header.
6.  **Escrow System Explanation (COMPLETED)**: A comprehensive explanation of the Cataloro Escrow system was provided, detailing its process flow, buyer/seller protection benefits, application ideas for Cataloro, and technical implementation considerations.
7.  **Webhooks Functionality (EXPLAINED/PENDING ACTIVATION)**: An explanation of webhooks' importance and a plan for their implementation were outlined, covering event types, endpoint management, retry logic, security, and monitoring. The button for webhooks is not yet active, and the management interface needs to be created.

The frontend service has been restarted after these latest changes to allow for testing.
