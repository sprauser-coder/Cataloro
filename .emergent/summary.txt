The AI engineer's trajectory involved a multi-phase development and debugging effort on a full-stack MERN-like application. Initially, critical backend security vulnerabilities, particularly unauthenticated admin endpoints and mock JWT token generation, were identified and resolved through systematic code modifications and the implementation of authentication middleware. This led to a series of frontend issues related to the Menu Settings feature, which required extensive debugging of URL construction, API call methods (fetch vs. axios), and the  hook's logic.

A significant portion of the work focused on addressing data inconsistencies in MongoDB regarding menu item visibility between desktop and mobile, often requiring direct database fixes. The AI also implemented a major new feature: admin-managed custom menu items with drag-and-drop functionality, which introduced its own set of icon rendering and positioning challenges. Throughout this, UI/UX refinements, such as cleaning up navigation duplicates and restructuring the Admin Panel, were continuously addressed. The process demonstrates a strong emphasis on detailed problem analysis, iterative bug fixing, and leveraging troubleshooting agents to pinpoint root causes, culminating in an ongoing effort to resolve persistent ads image upload failures and duplicate admin panel components.

The Cataloro Marketplace required substantial enhancements, primarily focused on mobile UI/UX, performance, and new features. Initial needs included fixing image handling, N+1 queries, React hooks violations, and consistent user ID management. Mobile UI/UX was critical, demanding fixes for navigation icons, menu streamlining, search functionality, and a full-screen messenger. An admin-activated ads system was also requested. Recent explicit requirements involved an ultra-modern login redesign with an admin-uploaded logo, removal of fast-login, and a comprehensive admin menu settings system offering role-based visibility control for both mobile and desktop navigation. The latest major feature request was to enable administrators to manually add custom menu items, supporting both internal pages and external URLs, with configurable target options, specific positioning, and drag-and-drop reordering. Currently, the ads image upload functionality needs to be fixed and duplicate admin panel components removed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report concerning two related issues: a duplicate Ads Management tab existing in the main admin panel, in addition to an integrated one under Administration, and the persistent failure of the image upload functionality specifically within the Administration Manager tab. The user explicitly requested the removal of the main Ads Management tab and a fix for the image upload in the remaining, integrated ads manager. The AI engineer had just finished an internal analysis confirming these two issues and formulated a two-step plan to address them, starting with removing the duplicate tab and then fixing the upload functionality.

I have just seen that there are two ad´s managers. One in Admin Panel as a main tab, and one as an ad´s manager in Admin Panel Please delete the one in the main admin panel, and only leave the one in the Administration tab. In the Administration Tab Ad´s manager, the image upload function does not work
