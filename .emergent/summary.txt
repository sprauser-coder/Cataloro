The trajectory details an iterative development process for the Cataloro Marketplace application, initially handed over with an Edit Side Menu bug. The AI engineer sequentially addressed user-reported issues: fixing the Edit Side Menu to display real navigation, resolving Admin Panel width, consolidating the Ads Manager, creating an Export Manager tile, implementing username verification, reactivating public profiles, and removing direct messaging. Despite several successful fixes, user frustration mounted due to recurring issues and regressions, particularly with the Ads Manager's functionality and look. Following multiple troubleshooting attempts and user complaints, the ultimate goal shifted to a full system cleanup and, crucially, the precise restoration of the Ads Manager to its original state from a provided  file. The current state is that the engineer has just finished restoring the Ads Manager code from the  and is poised to verify its functionality.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace aims for a scalable platform with robust inventory, role-based access, and enhanced UX, evolving from core improvements to advanced features like real-time, multi-currency, escrow, and AI. The recent phase focused on consolidating functionalities, eliminating dummy data, and improving the admin panel. Explicit user requirements included:
1.  **State-of-the-Art Messaging**: Modern, feature-rich messaging. The existing implementation was modified to remove direct messaging outside of sales transactions.
2.  **Rating System**: Backend and frontend activation, transaction-based, one-rating-per-user-pair. (Addressed in previous phase, verified implicitly in current trajectory.)
3.  **Enhanced User Profiles**: Populate with real backend data (Rating, Listings, Join Date, Statistics), activate Account Actions (Export Data (PDF), Delete Account with verification), prohibit existing usernames. Public profiles were to be reactivated.
4.  **UI Clean-up**: Remove currency from Browse page, remove bidding/similar items from Product page, enhance Inventory > Baskets Export PDF button. (Baskets PDF export was later completely removed by user request).
5.  **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Consolidate Ads Manager (with exact look and functionality from reference zip), add 'Edit Side Menu' with drag-and-drop (later explicitly deleted by user), create Export Manager tile (later explicitly deleted due to duplication/issues), fix admin panel content width.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React (Hooks, Context, Router), Tailwind CSS, .
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), Redis, Elasticsearch, WebSockets, ,  (for PDF generation).
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack (React/FastAPI/MongoDB), Kubernetes-ready, Role-Based Access Control.
-   **Data Handling**: UUIDs for MongoDB IDs, timezone-aware datetime.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of completely restoring the Ads Manager functionality to precisely match a version provided by the user in a  file (). The user explicitly stated, I want the adÂ´s manager to work exactliy like in the .zip file ! EXAKTLY THE SAME LOOK AND FUNCTIONALITY (Chat Message 314) and later reiterated this (Chat Message 365).

The AI engineer has successfully:
1.  Downloaded and extracted the provided  file.
2.  Analyzed the original  from the  to understand the  and its dependent components (, ).
3.  Replaced the entire  in the current application's  with the exact code for , , and  from the original  file. This action involved overwriting a significant portion of the  file to ensure an exact match.

The current state is that the code for the Ads Manager has been physically restored from the reference zip, but its end-to-end functionality and visual accuracy still need to be thoroughly tested. The last action performed was to write the restored code into the file.

<optional_next_step>
Test the newly restored Ads Manager in the Admin Panel to verify its exact look and functionality as per the  file.
