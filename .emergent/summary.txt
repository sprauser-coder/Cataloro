The previous AI engineer focused on the Cataloro Marketplace, implementing a mobile UI/UX redesign and a new ads management system. They confirmed mobile listings display correctly and fixed React Hooks errors in desktop messaging. The ads system was built from scratch, including backend API endpoints and a frontend admin panel component, with initial fixes for MongoDB ObjectId serialization and ensuring ads are inactive by default. The primary ongoing challenge is the mobile messenger, which remains stuck in loading conversations. Extensive debugging confirmed the backend messaging API is functional. The engineer systematically investigated frontend logic, confirming user login and mobile detection, but debug logs from the  component were consistently absent, indicating the component itself is not rendering. This has led to the decision to consult a .

The Cataloro Marketplace needs restoration and enhancement. Initial tasks involved fixing a 0 catalysts available bug, enhancing search, and improving basket export feedback. Recent explicit requests include:
-   **Hero Section**: Apply Admin Panel changes, add gradients, centering, and background wrapping.
-   **Performance**: Resolve slow fetching and phantom listings via caching.
-   **Mobile Redesign**: Implement a complete mobile UI/UX redesign, addressing icon errors,   issues, React Router navigation for login, streamlining mobile menus, fixing hero section text cutoff, styling the + button, removing Hot Deals and Message Now features, redesigning the mobile messenger for real-time data with full-screen display and auto-scroll, ensuring admin settings and logo display correctly, fixing individual listing page access, confirming listings display real data (now working), and implementing logout. Real-time badges for Messages and Cart are required on the bottom navigation.
-   **New Feature**: Implement an ads system where ads are inactive by default, requiring admin activation.
-   **Persistent Issues**: Listings were reported as not clickable/visible (now confirmed working on mobile), and mobile messages are not sending/loading.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting the mobile messaging functionality, specifically the  component. The component is stuck on Loading conversations... despite confirming that the backend API for messages is functional and returns data for the correct user ID.

The debugging process involved:
1.  Verifying backend logs for errors (none found).
2.  Manually testing the backend messages API with  using a known user ID, confirming it returns messages.
3.  Logging in as a demo user via the Demo User Experience button.
4.  Navigating to the mobile messages page, where the Loading conversations... state persisted.
5.  Extracting the correct logged-in user ID from  and re-verifying the backend API with it, confirming the API works for the active user.
6.  Adding extensive  statements to  to trace its rendering and  hooks, particularly for user context and conversation loading.
7.  Restarting the frontend service and re-testing.

The crucial observation is that the debug logs added to  are *not appearing* in the browser console. This indicates that the  component is likely not being rendered at all, even though  detection is confirmed to be . The last action was to call the  for assistance, as the issue appears to be related to the component's rendering or routing rather than the  interaction itself.
