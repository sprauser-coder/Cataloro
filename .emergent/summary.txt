<analysis>
The previous AI engineerâ€™s work traversed from comprehensive bug fixes and UI enhancements to preparing the Cataloro Marketplace for self-hosted deployment. Initial efforts focused on synchronizing notification badges, refining mobile layouts, and standardizing currency formatting (German Euro). Significant work was done on the profile pages, implementing real-time statistics, password changes, data export, account deletion, and avatar uploads, with careful attention to UI consistency across desktop and mobile.

Mid-trajectory, the engineer addressed several user-reported UI issues, including fixing admin panel tab visibility, ensuring menu settings consistency across mobile/desktop, updating active navigation button colors, and removing duplicate Create New Listing buttons. Each fix involved debugging frontend components and, in some cases, correcting backend data overrides.

The most recent phase pivoted to enabling self-hosted deployment. The engineer generated Dockerfiles, a , Nginx configurations, and setup scripts, providing detailed server preparation guidance for AlmaLinux. The process faced initial hurdles due to Git history conflicts and then a critical Docker build failure in the frontend due to a missing  file, indicating a mismatch in package manager usage (yarn vs npm). The current state is focused on resolving this deployment blockage.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace requires continuous improvement across its MVP application, focusing on bug fixes, design enhancements, and feature additions for both mobile and desktop users.

**Key product requirements addressed in this trajectory:**

1.  **Mobile UI/UX Refinements:** Fixed mobile tab layouts, improved responsiveness, removed blinking notification badges, hid tender messages, redesigned mobile profile tabs, ensured mobile user initial button navigation to profile, added View Public Profile menu item, and ensured full mobile/desktop parity.
2.  **Messaging & Notification Functionality:** Implemented read status for messages, visual indicators for unread messages, synchronized unread counts, and created specific notification routing rules for various event types. Ensured Mark all as read persistence.
3.  **Profile Management & Statistics:** Split full name, displayed real user statistics, dynamically changed mobile bottom navigation for sellers, implemented password change, removed 2FA and Privacy sections, enabled data export (PDF) and soft account deletion, displayed actual registration date, fetched public profile stats and info, simplified public profile listings, removed Send Email button, refined verified badge, ensured correct account status display, fixed Member Since date, and implemented functional profile picture upload with immediate UI update.
4.  **UI Consistency & Localization:** Removed My Bids icon, added number dividers to all Euro figures, positioned badges next to name on public profiles, redesigned tender result card, decreased Completion Details column size in Admin Panel with an info button, used username instead of full name in header, and updated menu items in Admin Panel > Menu Settings.
5.  **Deployment to Own Server:** User explicitly requested deployment scripts and step-by-step guidance for deploying the application to their own VPS server.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a MERN-like stack: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database, all running in a Kubernetes environment (local development) and now configured for Docker Compose deployment on a VPS. Backend API routes are prefixed with .



-   : Core backend API routes and business logic. Modified to update default menu settings (including Buy/Sell for mobile and desktop menus), handle various user profile features (password change, data export, soft delete, registration date, avatar upload), and ensure notification  consistency.
-   : (NEW) Dockerfile for the FastAPI backend service. Configured to install Python dependencies from  and run the FastAPI server using .
-   : Admin interface for managing menu items. Modified to correctly display and manage Buy and Sell options for both desktop and mobile menus after resolving database overrides.
-   : Desktop header, handles global notification routing. Updated to show  instead of full name, and changed active navigation button styling from blue to light gray. Also changed the user avatar icon color to match the logo's dark blue gradient.
-   : Central admin interface. Modified Completion Details column in Completed Transactions to be concise with an info button for full details.
-   : Displays other users' public profiles. Enhanced to show real statistics, user info, clickable recent listings, and refined badge placement.
-   : Displays a user's listings. The duplicate purple CREATE NEW LISTING button and its associated logic were removed.
-   : (NEW) Dockerfile for the React frontend service. Initially configured for yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in guiding the user through the process of deploying the Cataloro Marketplace application to their own VPS server. The server setup, including installing Docker and configuring the firewall on an AlmaLinux system, was successfully completed. The application codebase was cloned from GitHub into the  directory on the server.

The core deployment files (, , , , , ) were either confirmed to exist or created based on the generated deployment package.

The deployment process encountered a critical failure when attempting . Specifically, the frontend Docker build step failed with the error: . This indicates that the  was attempting to copy and install dependencies using yarn install v1.22.22
