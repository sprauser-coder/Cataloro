The previous AI engineer successfully developed the Cataloro marketplace from an MVP. Key achievements included deploying the React frontend and FastAPI backend, implementing user authentication, product listings, and a comprehensive 8-tab admin panel with CMS capabilities (site settings, appearance, page management). Crucial bug fixes and features were added: resolving React runtime errors, enabling image uploads for logos and listings, fixing global font application, and integrating hero section height adjustments. The previous work concluded with the AI clarifying a deployment discrepancy between the local development environment and a non-updating preview URL, guiding the user towards GitHub export for self-hosting.

The current trajectory began with a user request to fix a broken image upload functionality. The AI identified and resolved a critical bug in  related to incorrect operator precedence in file type validation for logo uploads. This fix was thoroughly verified with both backend and frontend automated tests. Following this, the user shifted focus to deploying the application to their self-hosted server at  (IP: 217.154.0.82). The AI has been actively guiding the user through the server setup, including upgrading Python and Node.js, installing PM2, cloning the codebase from GitHub, and installing dependencies. A notable detail is the downgrade of several backend packages during the  installation, which could be a point of attention later.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical image upload bug in  by correcting an operator precedence error in the  function ( to ). This fix was verified through comprehensive backend (14/14 tests passed) and frontend testing.

The primary ongoing task is deploying the Cataloro application to the user's self-hosted AlmaLinux 8.10 server at  (IP: 217.154.0.82). The server now has:
-   Python 3.11.13 and PM2 6.0.8 installed and aliased.
-   Node.js 20.19.4 installed, resolving previous  incompatibility.
-   MongoDB v6.0.25 running and enabled.
-   The Cataloro codebase successfully cloned from GitHub to .
-   Python backend dependencies installed from both general  commands and . A critical nuance is that installing from  led to *downgrades* of several core backend libraries (e.g., FastAPI from 0.116.1 to 0.68.0, Pydantic from 2.11.7 to 1.8.2, PyMongo from 4.14.1 to 3.12.3).
-   Frontend dependencies installed via yarn install v1.22.22
