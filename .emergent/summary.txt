The AI engineer's trajectory began with addressing critical performance issues in the Cataloro Marketplace's browse page. Initial efforts focused on backend optimizations: re-installing and verifying Redis, fixing N+1 queries in  via hybrid batching, implementing Redis caching for , and correcting a missing  method in . Backend tests confirmed significant performance gains (32-40% improvement, 0.73-1.03s response time for browse endpoint). Despite this, the user reported the browse page was still extremely slow on the frontend. This prompted a shift in focus to the frontend, where the  aided in identifying a hardcoded  in  as the root cause, leading to incorrect backend URL construction. The file was fixed, and services restarted. The current work involves meticulously re-examining how frontend API calls are formed in  and  to eliminate any lingering URL misconfigurations, specifically the potential for a double /api prefix.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro Marketplace initially required restoration from a corrupted  file, followed by several feature updates and bug fixes. Explicit user requests previously addressed included:
1.  **Feature Removal**: Deletion of Advanced Analytics and Phase 5 Features from the Admin Panel and associated codebase.
2.  **Comprehensive PDF Export**: Implementation of a dedicated PDF Export tab within Admin Panel > Administration for various report types.
3.  **Individual Basket PDF Export**: Addition of an export functionality for individual user baskets on the Inventory slow system performance.
The current, ongoing work specifically addresses a persistent user report that the system is still running very slow, particularly affecting the browse page's loading of listings, attributed by the user to conflicts in the database. The overarching goal is to make the application sleek and efficient.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was diligently working to resolve the user-reported issue of the Cataloro Marketplace's browse page still loading listings extremely slow on the frontend, despite all backend performance tests showing significant improvements (response times reduced to ~0.73-1.03 seconds).

The work flow involved:
1.  **Redis Operationalization**: Redis was found to be offline, requiring re-installation (version 7.0.15) and manual startup via  due to  unavailability. Its functionality was verified (), and the backend service was restarted to establish a successful connection, confirmed by backend logs.
2.  **Backend Performance Validation**: Multiple  tests directly to the  endpoint, along with a comprehensive run of , confirmed that backend optimizations (N+1 query resolution, Redis caching) were highly successful, achieving a 32-40% improvement in response times and robust data integrity.
3.  **Frontend Root Cause Identification**: Following the user's persistent complaint after successful backend tests, the  was engaged. This led to the discovery of a critical misconfiguration in , where  was hardcoded. This setting was overriding  from the  file, causing the frontend to construct API URLs incorrectly.
4.  **Frontend Configuration Fix**: The  file was edited to remove the problematic hardcoded  flag, ensuring  is correctly utilized. Services were restarted.
5.  **API Call Path Analysis**: The engineer then meticulously traced the API call path within the frontend, examining , , and . It was confirmed that  uses , which is formed as .
6.  **Backend Accessibility Confirmation**: A direct  test to the fully constructed URL () confirmed that the backend API is indeed accessible and responds very quickly (0.58 seconds).

The current state is that backend performance is confirmed excellent, and a major frontend configuration bug () has been fixed. The focus is now on ensuring the final URL construction in the frontend is flawless, specifically investigating any potential double API prefix issue that could still be causing incorrect routing or failures, despite individual components appearing correct.
