The previous AI engineer focused heavily on re-establishing a stable and functional deployment pipeline for the Cataloro marketplace. This involved extensive troubleshooting of environment-specific issues, including a missing  script, backend dependency conflicts (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Boto3, Cryptography), and critical Nginx reverse proxy misconfigurations that prevented frontend-to-backend communication. The complex server directory structure ( vs. ) caused repeated path issues in the deployment script, Nginx, and PM2 configurations, which were meticulously resolved. The frontend was configured to run via PM2 with , and its version display was dynamically linked to . Despite successfully getting both frontend and backend services online and confirming API functionality via direct  requests, the website's login process remained broken, exhibiting 404 errors and cookie domain issues in the browser. The database was verified, confirming data integrity and the correct admin credentials. The current state is a fully functional backend and Nginx proxy, with the problem now isolated to the frontend's API URL configuration.

<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace is an eBay-like e-commerce platform supporting buyer/seller roles, product listings, favorites, order management, and user reviews, managed via an 8-tab admin panel.
Initial implemented features include a dashboard, user statistics, listing image thumbnails, dynamic typography, custom themes, enhanced hero section, Content Management, Profile page, and a dynamic Footer.
The ongoing work aimed to address 8 critical issues: fixing profile recent activity/account actions, enabling View All Listings, enhancing the dashboard, improving admin user management, refining the notifications system, adding View Details for orders, and resolving categories management. Due to deployment issues, the live site reverted to an older UI version and explicitly lacks messaging functionality. The current focus is to stabilize the deployment and core application functionality, followed by implementing the modern UI design and messaging features.

<current_work>
The system is currently in a state where the deployment pipeline, including Git synchronization, dependency installation (frontend and backend), frontend build, and PM2 service management, is fully functional. Both the  and  PM2 processes are reported as  and  mode, respectively. The application version displayed on the website is 1.2.1.

Extensive debugging established that:
1.  **Backend API:** The FastAPI backend is running on  and successfully responds to direct  requests for various endpoints like , , , and . It returns valid JSON data and an  for the  user with password .
2.  **Nginx Proxy:** Nginx is active, properly configured to serve frontend static files from , and correctly proxies  requests to the backend.  requests sent through Nginx to public API endpoints also successfully return data, indicating the proxy is not the source of 404s for these specific endpoints.
3.  **Database:** MongoDB is running, and a direct query confirmed all previous data (12 users, 7 orders, 66 listings) is intact, including the  user.

However, despite these validations, the website's login functionality *still* fails from the browser, presenting 404 errors for CMS settings/navigation requests and cookie domain issues in the browser console. This indicates a disconnect within the frontend application itself, likely related to how it constructs API requests or interprets the backend URL. The current hypothesis is that the frontend is either using an incorrect  from its environment or has hardcoded URLs that do not align with the production setup, leading to requests for non-existent paths from its perspective.

<optional_next_step>
I will investigate the  in  and search for hardcoded backend URLs within the frontend's built JavaScript files.
