# Cataloro Marketplace Deployment Instructions

## Quick Fix for Current Issue

Your website is not accessible at https://cataloro.com because it needs proper web server setup. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Save to GitHub
Save all current changes to GitHub using the "Save to GitHub" feature.

### Step 2: Run Full Setup on VPS
SSH into your VPS and run:

```bash
cd /root/cataloro-marketplace
./deploy.sh setup
```

This will:
- Pull latest changes from GitHub
- Install and configure Nginx web server
- Create SSL certificates
- Build the React frontend for production
- Set up proper routing for https://cataloro.com

### Step 3: Verify
After setup completes, your website should be accessible at:
- https://cataloro.com
- http://cataloro.com (redirects to HTTPS)
