<product_requirements>
The Cataloro marketplace, an eBay-like e-commerce platform, is being enhanced with user and admin dashboard functionalities. Initial fixes included white screen, image, and login bugs, alongside UI/UX improvements. Feature additions comprised Admin Panel fixes, user ID migration to , account action activation, visitor analytics, footer management,  uploads, DNS/SSL guidance, and an SEO tab. More recently, a Browse Page Picker, Activity tab in Admin Panel, and a comprehensive User Profile page (stats, activity, listings, orders, favorites, messages, reviews, settings) were requested, along with a Clear Statistics button. Specific user requests included individual real-time statistics, all connections to , and consistent admin dashboard statistics. Recent explicit requests involved activating Activity, Listings, Orders, Favorites tabs, Change Profile, public profile view, enhanced activity tracking, a listings sort picker, Order Details button, and a show seller button. The AI engineer was most recently tasked with displaying updated admin names, integrating visitor analytics, completing the Clear Statistics button, and adding a show seller button, all while ensuring a smooth deployment process.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep in a debugging loop to resolve persistent backend service failures after deployment. The problem started with the backend () continuously entering an errored state in PM2, despite the frontend () running successfully and showing version .

The troubleshooting sequence revealed:
1.  **Initial Backend Error ( not found)**: The  indicated that  was configured to run a non-existent file, , instead of .
2.  **Fixing **: The AI modified  to correctly point to  and explicitly set the  to . It also added log file paths and created a  directory in the  script.
3.  **Persistent **: Despite the  fix, the backend continued to crash with , first for , then consistently for . This indicated that PM2 was not correctly accessing the Python packages installed via

5.  **Attempting PM2 Process Reset**: The AI tried to delete the old PM2 backend process and restart it, but this failed because the  command was run from the  directory, and PM2 expects the config file in the project root ().
6.  **Current State**: The backend is still errored due to , and the AI is in the process of updating the version to  while considering the incorrect location of  for PM2 startup. The core issue is getting PM2 to correctly load the Python environment with all installed dependencies.
